I live in San Francisco where I work as a Software Engineer at [OpenDNS](https://www.opendns.com). I graduated last year from Washington University in St. Louis with majors in Systems Engineering and in Physics. I started and run the [OpenLate Meetup Group](http://meetup.com/openlate) for engineers in the Bay. I write for various websites including the [OpenDNS blog](http://blog.opendns.com) and [Telegraph Research](http://telegraphresearch.com). On the side I work on [StaffJoy](https://www.staffjoy.com). For fun I [salsa dance](/salsa-videos/), [participate in local events](/video-quantified-self/), and [read](http://goodreads.com/philipithomas).
