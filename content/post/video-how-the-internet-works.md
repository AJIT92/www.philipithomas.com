In May I gave a presentation to [Hackbright Academy](http://hackbrightacademy.com/), an engineering fellowship program in San Francisco where I mentor, about how the internet works. The goal of the talk is teaching the basics of internetwork communication to students with some background in web development. 

The video is now online - [see the slides and more information on my prior post](/how-the-internet-works/)
