Last month, Salesforce held its annual [Dreamforce](http://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/DF13/) convention in San Francisco. As I passed the massive 100,000 person gathering day, I became interested in learning more about the company. So, I picked up and read [Behind the Cloud: The Untold Story of How Salesforce.com Went from Idea to Billion-Dollar Company-and Revolutionized an Industry](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002PJ4SU2/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B002PJ4SU2&linkCode=as2&tag=sagacionlook-20). Written by Salesforce Founder Marc Benioff, the book serves as an autobiographical account of Marc's transition from being an Oracle exectuive to running an international software company. When I  began reading the book, I didn't realize that it would also send me on a little bit of an adventure. 


## The Book

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002PJ4SU2/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B002PJ4SU2&linkCode=as2&tag=sagacionlook-20"><img class="img-float" border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B002PJ4SU2&Format=_SL110_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=sagacionlook-20" ></a>
Marc's book stood out from other stories of technology companies because it focused mostly on sales and hustle instead of innovation and technology. This is not to say that Salesforce was not defined by innovation - they pioneered on-demand software, which is now about a $12 billion industry. However, Marc treats innovation as a singular turning points in the book, followed by long periods of negotations, advertising, and hard work. 

Throughout the story, it becomes clear that Marc's ability to build and maintain relationships is pivotal to the success of Salesforce. This starts right at the founding - Marc left Oracle, where he was a senior vice president, to work on Salesforce. However, rather than burn bridges, he turned Oracle Founder Larry Ellison into an early investor in his new company. He was even allowed to pick three employees from Oracle to bring with him to Salesforce. This pattern of business acumen continues throughout the growth of Salesforce, and becomes most clear during the international expansion of Salesforce, where Marc describes the relationships and hustle necessary to enter the European, Australian, and Asian markets. 

## The Apartment

Near the beginning of the book, one section caught my eye: 


> On March 8, 1999, Parker Harris, Frank Dominguez, and Dave Moellenhoff began working in a one-bedroom apartment I’d rented at 1449 Montgomery, next door to my house. We didn’t have office furniture, so we used card tables and folding chairs. What we lacked in furnishings, we made up for with an amazing view of the San Francisco Bay Bridge.

While still working at Oracle, Marc started the development of Salesforce right next to his house. I realized that this address was around the corner from where I live in San Francisco! So, I set out to find 1449  Montgomery - the apartment where Salesforce.com began.

I walked down Montgomery Street on top of Telegraph Hill toward the historic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filbert_Street_(San_Francisco)">Filbert Steps</a>, and I was disappointed to see that 1449 Montgomery seemed to be tucked between two buildings, and accessible only via a clearly-marked private staircase. Not discouraged, I decided to take the steps up to Coit Tower, to see if I could spot any promising buildings from above. On my way up, I noticed a small, public sidewalk that shot into the houses where I suspected the apartment to be. The first houses were labeled "Telegraph Hill Boulevard," but I figured that I would still check. 

Lo and behold, along a quiet, pedestrian-only sidewalk, I stumbled a small, gated building:

There it was - the original 1-bedroom apartment where three employees started what would become a $1 billion company.

In the book, another passage caught my eye:

> It wasn’t long before our growing staff appropriated my house next door. The developers strung Ethernet cable out the office window, through the redwood trees, and into my home so that we could all communicate. (These were the dark days before wireless.)

This meant that one of these houses around the apartment was also where Marc lived, and where Salesforce began to expand when the seams on the 1-bedroom apartment began to bulge. 

I've emailed Marc to ask for verification, but my intuition says that it is the house on the north side:

The view from the apartment is beautiful, covering the Bay Bridge, Treasure Island, and much of San Francisco Bay.

What surprised me was that I had looked at this apartment many times in the past - it is visible from the parking lot at [Coit Tower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coit_Tower), and that is where some of these photos were taken. I stood directly behind this apartment while watching the end of many [America's Cup](http://www.americascup.com/) races this summer. 

The next time you are at Coit Tower, look down from the parking lot, toward the Bay Bridge, and notice the small brown building where Salesforce.com made its first home:
