This week [WUSTL](http://wustl.edu) student startup [Sparo Labs](http://www.sparolabs.com) won the $25,000 grand prize in the inaugural [Discover Competition](http://engineering.wustl.edu/disc-comp.aspx). Joining their team for the competition was an exciting experience for me - I led the development of a software prototype that interfaces with their spirometer, processes the signal, and displays the results to users. A static demonstration site is available at [Demo.SparoLabs.com](http://demo.sparolabs.com).
