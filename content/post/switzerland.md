After hearing murmurs of the military culture in Switzerland, I wanted to delve deeper into the history of Switzerland. This weekend I read [La Place de la Concorde Suisse](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005E8AINW/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B005E8AINW&linkCode=as2&tag=sagacionlook-20) by John McPhee. The degree to which business, culture, and infrastructure are intergrated with the military in Switzerland was mindblowing. John's book paints a picture of a culture that prides itself on military preparedness. On short notice, they can mobilize their military, seal off the country from invaders, and put every citizen in a bunker. It may seem extreme, but this historical strategy kept Switzerland neutral for the last 500 years, including in World War 1 and World War 2. 

## Facts

1. Military service is mandatory for all men, and they typically stay as reserve officers for 30 years. This means that 10% of the people of Switzerland are in the army. Business and the military are tightly intertwined, so the heads of the majors Swiss Banks are usually officers in the military.

2. Every bridge and tunnel in the country has a demolition plan to allow the military to seal off access to the country on short notice. Often, civil engineers who designed the bridge also are tasked with planning its destruction. 

3. Every Swiss military member must keep their service rifle and ammunition in their homes. They may be mobilized with 48 hours notice at any time. 

4. In 500 years, Switzerland has had only four generals. They are appointed only in times of conflict. The last, [Henri Guisan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Guisan), was hailed as a national hero for keeping the country out of World War II.

5. Swiss mercenery soldiers served in countless wars for other countries, and the country's banks were largely started by wages from war. The main vestige of this past is the 135 Swiss soldiers that continue to defend the Vatican.

6. Einstein became a Swiss citizen in 1901, but avoided serving in the regular army due to "varicose veins and flat feet."

7. Switzerland has enough bomb shelters for its whole population in the event of a nuclear attack. Included in this is the largest nuclear bunker in the world, the [Sonnenberg tunnel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonnenberg_Tunnel).
