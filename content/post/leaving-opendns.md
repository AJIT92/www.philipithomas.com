I sent the following email this morning as I spend my last day at [OpenDNS](http://www.opendns.com). An update about my new project is coming tomorrow.

> Dear OpenDNS,
>
> Today is my last day at OpenDNS. I joined two and a half years ago after graduating from college. I believed in the vision of OpenDNS and saw its potential to achieve that dream by the passionate team here. Today, we have succeeded in bringing meaningful security to millions of people, and the Cisco acquisition allows us to amplify our products to the whole world.
> 
> Iâ€™m sad to be leaving, but excited to be embarking on our own entrepreneurial journey. Please stay in touch.

> Philip
