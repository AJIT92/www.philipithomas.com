Last week I spoke at the [OpenLate Meetup Group](http://meetup.com/openlate) about technology community building. I started OpenLate last year as a place to code in the evenings, and it grew into a speaker series with over 2700 members in 2 countries. 

This talk focuses on the story of OpenLate and the lessons we learned along the way. As engineers, we like automation - so I wrote a manual about how to run OpenLate. You can read it here: **[OpenLate Run Book](https://opendns.app.box.com/OpenLateMeetupRunbook).** 

As I [transitioned to StaffJoy full-time](/starting-staffjoy), I handed the reigns of OpenLate to Eric Reynolds. Eric and I worked on the [OpenResolve](https://www.openresolve.com/) project together, and I am excited to see how he continues the growth of the meetup.
