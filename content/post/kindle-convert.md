Paper books enamor me. Selling back textbooks in college seemed a foreign concept to me - bookshelves served as a physical representation of what I had learned, both to me and my visitors. E-book readers seemed to rid one of my favorite hobbies of its intimacy and artistry.   

During the rigmarole of my college graduation two months ago, I simultaneously prepared to move from St. Louis to San Francisco. Getting rid of my furniture, extra kitchenware, and other clutter felt cathartic as I embarked to start a new life in a new city. However, I hesitated to get rid of a single book. When I had thirteen boxes of books and two suitcases of clothing leftover from packing, I knew that my whole library could not accompany me on my journey.

The Amazon Kindle always amused me, but I could never justify buying one during college because most of my technical textbooks were unavailable for purchase on the device, and because mathematical formulae and diagrams did not display well on the e-ink screen. I also concluded that I would likely end up purchasing both a physical copy and a digital copy of each book I read - the former for my collection, and the latter for convenience.   

Unable to justify shipping 13 boxes of books across the country, I packed a single box with my favorite books to ship to San Francisco, sold back a couple dozen titles to Amazon, and drove the remaining boxes to my parents' house for future retrieval. 

With the credit from the books I sold back to Amazon, I purchased a [Kindle Paperwhite](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007OZNZQ0/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B007OZNZQ0&linkCode=as2&tag=sagacionlook-20). 

When the device arrived, my childhood self who always read with his camping headlamp in bed seemed reawakened as I read for hours at night with the backlit reader.  

As the weeks rolled on and I completed my move, the Kindle fit snugly into my lifestyle. Like paperless credit card statements, the latest issue of The Economist beams itself to me every week. When I highlight snippets in technical books, I can retrieve the sections on the Kindle Mac App at work. Having a readout of estimated minutes remaining in a chapter or in the whole book appeals to tech-y side of me. And, of course, being able to buy a book on my phone and have it download immediately has spoiled my patience. 

Being able to hit the "share" button at the end of a book surprisingly motivates me to read more. Broadcasting my latest read to friends on Facebook and Twitter has prompted many offline conversations and even resulted in gifted e-books.

Now in San Francisco, the Kindle has become my constant companion - a library in my pocket. Having eschewed most possessions as I boarded a one-way flight with two suitcases, the Kindle fills a niche I did not know existed in my life.  

While I still feel like a crusty hermit who desires a stack of paper in his hand, I now realize that the beauty of the Kindle is that it makes other concerns melt away, thus empowering me to spend more time doing what I love - reading.
