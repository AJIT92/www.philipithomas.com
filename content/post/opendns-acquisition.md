Today is an exciting day as Cisco acquires OpenDNS. I [joined OpenDNS after graduating from college](/joining-open-dns/) because I saw innovative technology, ambitious leadership, and strong growth potential. When I joined in May 2013, OpenDNS had about 70 employees with humble growth and a strong vision. Today, we have over 300 employees and world-class security technology that protects some of the largest companies in the world.

As an engineer, seeing people use tools that we built is exciting. The Cisco acquisition  provides the opportunity to extend our systems we have built with many more users.

In the words of [David](http://david.ulevitch.com) - "On on".
