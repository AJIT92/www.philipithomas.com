This week I am attending the [HTML5 Developer Conference](http://html5devconf.com/) in San Francisco. Five years ago a small group of web programmers started the annual event, and it event grew to the point of moving to the [Moscone Center](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscone_Center), the largest conference center in the city, for the first time this year.

Walking up for the day's registration, I stepped in line outside of Moscone North, only to realize that I was in line for the major Apple press conference in the same building. It amused me that Tim Cook lurked nearby with Apple's newest gadgets.

The HTML5 Developer Conference kicked off with its founder, Ann Burkett, stating that the beauty of the gathering was that it was developer-initiated, not corporate-focused. Then, Christos Georgiopoulos from the event's primary sponsor, Intel, took the stage for the day's keynote, which was an hour of cringe-worthy corporate autofellatio. 

The sponsor exhibition area was a mix of established companies and new startups. Intel occupied the largest area, and they organized a scavenger hunt-like program with prizes for those who attended its speaking events. Interestingly, the Yahoo booth seemed the busiest. Attendees lined up to enter a raffle for programming books using a Google Docs form (*I kid you not*). The motley mix of new and old Yahoo logos added to the disorder. 

Talks throughout the day differed in technical detail, presenter ability, and coporate undertones. Speakers were comprised of a mix of young hotshot programmers with their Macbooks and crusty old [Stallman](http://stallman.org/)-types with their Linux laptops. 

I attended a speech by Misko Hevery, author of [Angular.js](http://angularjs.org/) framework and Google engineer. The talk focused on the future of Angular.js and its speculative goals for the far-off 2.0 version. As somebody with no Angular.js experience, I was mostly lost during the discussion. However, hearing insight from the author of one of the most cutting-edge javascript tools served as a window into the future of the web. 

[Christophe Coenraets](http://coenraets.org/) from Adobe gave a surpisingly surprisingly informative talk about [Phonegap](http://phonegap.com) and [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/). It focused little on Phonegap, a cross-platform mobile application system recently acquired by Adobe. Instead, it provided a quite understandable introduction to Backbone.js and the basics of single-page web applicatons. 

Though I was unable to attend, whispers circulated about the talk by [Sumit Amar](https://twitter.com/ChiefCoder), the new Director of Engineering at Electronic Arts. His speech focused on a technical topic - memory management in infinite scrolling. However, Sumit lacked credibility as questions from the audience about DOM event handling apparently threw him off. After a member from the audience began correcting his answers, attendees left in droves. 

I enjoyed the afternoon panel of [W3C](http://www.w3.org/) members. They represented the crusty technologists who live on mailings  lists and handle the beaucrocracy of standardizing the specifications behind web browsers like Chrome and Firefox. I felt surprised when the panel addressed the elephant in the room by disparagingly criticizing the young Microsoft employee on the panel for the shortcoming of prior Internet Explorer releases and for the premature implementation of draft standards in the newly-released Internet Explorer 11. 

I looked forward to the talk by Colt McAnlis of Google. Fifteen minutes after the speech was supposed to begin in the conference's largest room, the large audience began to trickle out. Colt never showed up. 

I ended the day by attempting to attend a speech about large Backbone.js applications by Jeremy Lu of [Pubulous](http://pubulous.com). However, I found the room so packed that, even with my 6'1" height, I could not see the projector. I instead attended a talk by Jacob Rossi about integrating touch gestures into web applications. The talk seemed refreshing because of its focus on HTML5 itself instead of Javascript. I then realized that Jeremy was the vilified Microsoft representative on the W3C panel earlier that day, and that he was demonstrating the premature technology that  Microsoft had implemented against the urging of the open source community. Everything he was demonstrating only worked in Internet Explorer 11, and likely would never be supported its current form in future browsers. 

Overall for the day, here are some of my favorite discoveries:

* Adobe is working on a Bootstrap-like open source CSS framework, [Topcoat](http://topcoat.io/)
* [Fastclick.js](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick) speeds up click actions by touchscreen users. Drop it into Twitter bootstrap to make dropdown menus more snappy. 
* When working with front-end frameworks, [Postman](http://www.getpostman.com/) for Google Chrome makes it easy to simulate an API. 
* Enable hardware acceleration of all graphics using simple CSS by invoking <pre>translate3d(0,0,0)</pre>.

Tomorrow I look forward most to these three talks:

* [Which Way is Forward](http://html5devconf.com/speakers/douglas_crockford.html) by Douglas Crockford from Paypal
* [SUPERHUB route planning w/ Leaflet.js, and D3.js](http://html5devconf.com/speakers/sampumon_kaipiainen.html#session) by Sampumon Kaipiainen
* [Web Graphics for Science](http://html5devconf.com/speakers/jasper_vandegronde.html#session) by Dr. Jasper van de Gronde
