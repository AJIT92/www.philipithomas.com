[No Better Time: The Brief, Remarkable Life of Danny Lewin, the Genius Who Transformed the Internet](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0306821664/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0306821664&linkCode=as2&tag=sagacionlook-20) by Molly Knight Raskin documents the 31-year life of Danny Lewin, the Founder of [Akamai Technologies](https://www.google.com/finance?cid=663784). What Danny accomplished between the ages of 18 and 31 blew my mind. 

Danny was raised in Colorado until the age of 14, when his parents uprooted the family to make [aliyah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah) to Israel. At the age of 18, he joined the most elite Israel Defense Forces  special operations unit, [Sayeret Matkal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayeret_Matkal). There, he participated in classified anti-terrorism missions such as assassinations and kidnappings. Danny left the IDF after three years with the rank of Captain. 

At the age of 21, Danny's life took a turn as he married and began studying at the [Technion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technion_%E2%80%93_Israel_Institute_of_Technology). After graduating with highest honors at age 24, he moved back to the United States to begin a Ph.D. program in Theoretical Computer Science at MIT. There, he developed a [consistent hashing algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing) that became the focus of much of his work. It was around this time that Danny's colleagues began referring to him as a "genius."

When Danny's wife and first son moved to the USA to join him, the family struggled financially. At age 28, Danny entered an MIT business plan competition in pursuit of its $50,000 prize. That would kick off the creation of [Akamai Technologies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akamai_Technologies), which utilized Danny's consistent hashing algorithm to delivery internet content at scale. 

Less than 18 months after starting the company, while Danny was 29 years old, Akamai went public with an over $20 billion valuation. Like a digital FedEx service, today Akamai powers between 15% and 30% of the world's internet traffic using Danny's consistent hashing algorithm. 

Over the following two years, during the [dot-com bubble burst](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble), the company's stock price plummeted. When Danny boarded  [American Airlines Flight 11](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_11) on the morning of September 11, 2001, he was flying to Los Angeles on business in seat 9B. [Evidence indicates](http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch1.htm) that, when five Al-Qaeda members seated around Danny began to hijack the plane, Danny's commando training kicked in as he fought back, and he was  subsequently killed by a terrorist seated behind him. This made Danny Lewin the first death of the very first victim of the [September 11 attacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks).

In the thirteen years between the ages of 18 and 31, Danny Lewin's disparate accomplishments made him seem like a modern-day [Bruce Wayne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman). From being a commando, to working toward a doctoral degree at MIT, to being a billionaire entrepreneur, to being a hero, he embodied audacity. Molly Knight Raskin's book weaved together this complicated life into the story of an incredible learner. An understanding of Danny's personality and goals begins to emerge as the reader observes Danny's ability to go from novice to expert in almost any field, from IPO accounting to firearms, in a period of days. Though Danny's life suffered a tragic early end, his accomplishments were nothing short of remarkable.
