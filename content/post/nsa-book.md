[James Bamford](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bamford), the author, is a journalist who served as a key witness in an ACLU lawsuit against the NSA wiretapping program. In this book, he shares a comprehensive, well-documented look at modern signal intelligence from the late 90s to the beginning of the Obama presidency. The level of detail, particularly with regard to the events leading to September 11, surprised me - the author reconstructs the parallel timelines of the 9/11 hijackers, NSA analysts, and political leadership in the year preceding the attack. 

While the public has at least become aware of the basics of NSA surveillance, having a single resource that weaves together the actions of NSA leadership, the White House, the Office of the Attorney General, and Congress helped me to better understand the changes in technology, scope, international cooperation, and legal atmosphere of the warrantless spying program. Specifically, the details about internal actions and programs at the NSA are presented so plainly that the story about the most secret agency in the world seems almost fictional. 

What follows are three of my favorite stories that I learned from the book:

## Outage

On January 24, 2000, the entire NSA headquarters computer network went offline. Due to a snowstorm that followed, the whole agency was unable to process any data for three days. The incident was considered an operational emergency of the highest secrecy - if it leaked that the NSA was unable to inform the military and other agencies, international disaster could have ensued. The problem turned out to be an “outdated routing protocol” that took $1.5 million of hardware and software upgrades to fix. Fortunately, data from the preceding days was not lost and could be processed retroactively.

## Imagineering

[Eric C. Haseltine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Haseltine) spent a spent a decade leading the research and development group of Walt Disney Imagineering, the innovation core of the Disney Parks. In 2002, he left transitioned from building robots that entertain children to large-scale surveillance as he became the Director of Research at the NSA. 

## Attorneys General Revolt

From 2001 to 2004, the NSA warrantless surveillance program ran almost unchecked. With the support of the Bush Administration through an executive order that exempted the data collection from having to pursue FISA warrants, the action was considered acceptable due to certification by the Justice Department that the act was legal. This certification had to be renewed, and by 2004 Attorney General Ashcroft had changed opinions on the legality of the current program due to the insight from new Assistant Attorney General Jack Goldsmith. Without recertification by the Justice Department, the NSA would have to shut down much of its data collection - specifically the data pertaining to US citizens - when the certification expired. With an unfortunate medical condition requiring the immediate removal of his gallbladder in the days preceding this deadline, Ashcroft was hospitalized and unable to lead the Justice Department, thus relinquishing control to Deputy Attorney General James Comey. What followed was a dramatic look into the politics of the Bush Administration that involved desperate attempts to get the program reauthorized. The desperation reached a crescendo as President Bush personally contacted the hospitalized Ashcroft and attempted to send personnel to receive his signature of approval while he was still handicapped.
Their efforts ultimately proved unsuccessful, and the program was not recertified. However, the Bush Administration chose to continue the spying program unchanged. The implications of continuing an illegal program rattled the Justice Department. Key players, including Attorney General Ashcroft, Deputy Attorney General Comey, and FBI Director Robert Mueller planned a mass resignation similar to the [Saturday Night Massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Massacre) that was a tipping point in the Watergate Scandal. The pressure from these resignations ultimately forced the White House to implement changes to bring the surveillance program back into compliance with the law.
