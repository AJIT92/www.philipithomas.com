Neighborhoods define San Francisco. From the microclimates to the history to the people, every area of the city has its own defining traits and resulting culture. I have found that the best way to meet and observe San Francisco locals in their natural habitats is to visit coffee shops. I explored the major neighborhoods of San Francisco in an effort to identify the cafes that share the authentic culture of their neighborhoods.

## The Mission: Four Barrel Coffee


The coffee epicenter of San Francisco is the Mission neighborhood. The young, trendy community with strong Latin roots holds everything from [the most life-changing burrito](http://www.esquire.com/blogs/food-for-men/el-farolito-best-burrito-winner-15120286) to a [porn studio in a castle](/sf-armory/). The Mission treats coffee shops with reverence reserved for wine bars in most other neighborhoods. Chief among these cafes is [Four Barrel Coffee](http://fourbarrelcoffee.com/). 

The Four Barrel cafe feels like a coffee laboratory. In the rear, burlap bags of green coffee surround the cast-iron roaster through which all of the beans pass. In the middle of the shop is the main coffee bar, where espresso-based drinks and pour-over coffee are prepared. It is not your traditional cafe, though - no tea is available, and only whole milk is stocked.

Near the front is a hidden treasure - a "slow" coffee bar where various beans are laid out like jewelry. There, the baristas are happy talk about coffee and its unique qualities in a personal experience that feels like a trip to the Genius Bar at the Apple Store. 

On weekends, a line forms out the door of young professionals donning skinny jeans, ironic t-shirts, and glasses with oversized plastic frames. Don't  bother asking about wifi - Four Barrel tries to create the perfect coffee experience, not an internet cafe.

Idiosyncrasies aside, Four Barrel elevates coffee to a craft and an art in a neighborhood that supports such a pursuit. 

## SoMa: Sightglass Coffee


During my first-ever trip to San Francisco, I stopped by [Sightglass Coffee](https://sightglasscoffee.com/) for an espresso. It became quickly apparent that the shop was filled with programmers, investors, and other tech geeks. I recognized the company logo on somebody's bag and introduced myself. Ears in the cafe perked when they heard that I was graduating from engineering school the following month and looking for a job in tech. I left Sightglass with a stack of business cards and had interviews the following week with tech companies because of that visit.

South of Market, known as SoMa, is the startup neighborhood of San Francisco where billions of dollars have been made and lost in innovative technology companies. Sightglass treats coffee like a startup tech company, and its investors include billionaire Jack Dorsey of [Twitter](http://twitter.com) and [Square](http://squareup.com) fame.

Sightglass takes the traditional cafe approach, then throws money and gadgetry at it. Their La Marzocco Strada espresso machines are notoriously unreliable, but use high-tech digital pressure control system that make them one of the most advanced and expensive espresso machines on the market. Sightglass was also one of the very first vendors to use [Square](http://squareup.com) in place of a traditional cash register.

The shop itself feels extravagant with many seats, multiple coffee bars, a massive roaster, training areas, and office space - all decked out with the best equipment available. In terms of sheer square footage, it is one of the largest coffee shops in the city in a neighborhood where median rent for a one-bedroom apartment is about $3,000 a month.

If Starbucks is known for over-roasting its coffee, Sightglass is known for under-roasting. Their espresso is delicious, but the flavor profiles of their beans seem narrow. 

If you are looking for the caffeine powering San Francisco's most innovative companies, visit Sightglass Coffee.

## Financial District: Capital One 360 Cafe

The Financial District stands out in San Francisco because it is the only neighborhood with skyscrapers and suits. In a neighborhood dedicated to money, where better may one go than a coffee shop owned and operated by a bank. The [Capital One 360 Cafe](http://cafes.capitalone360.com/san_francisco/) is a community project by Capital One Bank to create open dialogue about money by injecting financial advice into your morning coffee.

It will catch you off guard when the cashier takes your card, looks at the logo, and begins asking you about your bank. "Do you like your bank? Capital One checking accounts have no fees, and you get half off of your coffee here. Have you considered opening an account?" To avoid the hassle, I've started paying in cash. 

Employees are clearly hired as salespeople, not coffee experts - they use automated push-button machines that spit out sludge resembling espresso. All the drinks are cheap though, so a visit makes financial sense.

Expect to see suits, Blackberries, Windows laptops, and eother artifacts of a less high-tech San Francisco.

## Marina: Rapha Cycle Club Cafe

If your North Face jacket isn't protecting you well enough on your bike rides during the brisk SF summer, check out the Rapha Cycle Club in the Marina. This high-end boutique selling designer European bike racing gear isn't about function - it's about fitting in. Don't expect quick service from the salespeople unless your Rolex is clearly visible from a distance.

Amid the bike gear is the [Rapha Cycle Club Cafe](http://www.rapha.cc/sfr) selling espresso drinks to help you energize for the trip down the block to the Yacht Club. The coffee is quite decent, but don't be surprised if the person before you in line pays with an Amex Black Card. This is not the type of cafe where are welcome to hang around too long - the staff is not too friendly, but that is par for the course in the Marina neighborhood. 

## North Beach: Cafe Trieste 

<img src="/images/cafe-crawl/northbeach.jpg" alt="Cafe Trieste" class="full"/>

A trip to [Cafe Trieste](http://www.caffetrieste.com/) in North Beach feels like a step into a more historic San Francisco. The roots of the neighborhood are Italian, but nowadays that identity has faded. 

Cafe Trieste began roasting its own coffee long before it was trendy. However, the preferred beverage of most patrons is a glass of wine. The shop feels like a step into a simpler, more relaxed San Francisco, and it is one of the few coffee shops not crowded by young professionals on laptops. Instead, the artsy customers, descendants of the [Beat Generation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_Generation), are often seen reading from paper books and writing with actual pens.

To understand the cultural roots of San Francisco prior to the dot-com era, visit Cafe Trieste.


## Wharf: Starbucks

When you need a caffeine jolt after getting off of your bus tour before you head to Alcatraz, Starbucks in the Wharf is your place to go. Conveniently located next to the long line for a Cable Car ride, it will provide that familiar burnt taste you desire right before you realize that it will cost about $50 for your family to take a round-trip ride on the city's famous cable cars. 

Unfortunately your mocha will not be made with Ghiradelli chocolate, but it's ok because Ghiradelli no longer makes chocolate at their factory around the corner anyways. In an neighborhood that thrives on throngs of tourists, Starbucks will give you the true Wharf experience of chain restaurants and fictitious culture. 

## Tenderloin: Mirex

Sometimes, you just need affordable, non-pretentious coffee. Mirex in the Tenderloin delivers that. For $1.25, you get a warm cup of caffeine. Pay no attention to the used needles or funny smells on the sidewalk outside, and try to leave the area before dark. If you need cash, there's an ATM built into the outside of the store. There's no alcohol here, so if you're looking for whiskey in a brown paper bag, you'll have to go elsewhere.
