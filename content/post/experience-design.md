What defines a brand? Successful businesses do more than treat a sale as a singular event - they create an ecosystem so powerful that customers develop an emotional tie to the company. Brands such as Nordstrom, Zappos, and American Express have perfected messaging, consumer relationships, and sales to create strong ties to the primary stakeholders, the customers. Experience design serves as a strategy for building such a relationship with customers using a multi-faceted approach across marketing, design, and product. 

Last month, I attended a lecture by Kevin Farnham, the Founder and CEO of [Method](http://method.com), at the [Academy of Art University](http://www.academyart.edu/) in San Francisco. Kevin discussed the approach to combining business and design using [experience design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_design). Method began providing design services to clients in San Francisco in 1998, and the company has since grown to serve Fortune 100 clients such as Google, Reuters, and Nissan from offices in San Francisco, New York City, and London.

Kevin's lecture served as my introduction to experience design. It refers to a process that integrates a variety of approaches to synergize the customer experience by architecting all interactions, including those after purchase. Controlling the brand, engagement, and products/services serve as the pathway to creating an engaging relationship between business and the end users.

The short lecture piqued my interest, but left me with more questions than answers. Specifically, the relationship between marketing, branding, and experience design confused me. Thus, I purchased and read the book [Experience Design](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ENJM82W/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00ENJM82W&linkCode=as2&tag=sagacionlook-20), co-authored by Kevin and  Patrick Newbery, a Method Principal. The novel is split in to three sections. First, a philosophy of design is presented that explains the goals and procedure of experience design. Second, frameworks for understanding and implementing experience design are presented based on the client work of Method. Third, the authors discuss creating actionable business plans based on the conclusions of their frameworks. 

Concretely explaining experience design seems difficult to achieve. The book seems to skirt around a simple description as much as a Shakespearean sonnet. The simple explanation I came up with: Experience design personifies a brand. This becomes clearer in the book as *Brand* is always capitalized. By creating consistent, architected experiences between a customer and a company, an engaging relationship results that builds an emotional connection between the consumer and the organization. The best experience design strategies build such a strong relationship with end users that "fanboy" status results. The [diagram of the Customer Journey Framework](http://experiencedesignthebook.com/pdf/Customer-Journey-Framework.pdf) illustrates the dynamic, ongoing nature of the relationship. 

As a newcomer to experience design, I felt frustrated by the lack of examples presented in the book. While the authors aim to create a persistent, academic framework based on a mindset rather than quick examples or generic approaches, I felt that further analysis was necessary to make the book educational. Based on the lecture and from my readings, the ultimate example of experience design is Apple. 

Purchasing an Apple product extends far beyond the transaction of money for a piece of technology. Apple Stores are designed to provide a specific environment that evokes the brand. Interactions between salespeople and customers have roots in luxury hotel training programs. Products are accessible for testing. When paying, the experience remains personal as employees use an iPhone instead of a cash register. The experience continues after purchase. Large product containers have a handle built in to make leaving the store easy. When opening the product, the packaging materials are chic. Even the lack of an instruction manual and the configuration screen on electronics are intentional. A visit for repairs to the Genius Bar feels intimate. New product releases feel exciting. This whole product experience is completely designed to evoke the Apple brand, and replicating such an experience is the approach of experience design.
