For the past year, [Andrew Hess](http://andhess.com) and I have been building [StaffJoy](https://www.staffjoy.com), an application that helps businesses control labor costs. Until now, the project has been a side pursuit. This week, we are transitioning to working on StaffJoy full-time.

My interest in workforce scheduling started with my [senior project](http://scheduling.philipithomas.com) at Washington University in St. Louis. The core innovation of StaffJoy is the novel approach it takes to workforce scheduling, which allows us to schedule large workforces in record time with limited computing resources.

StaffJoy automates shift scheduling for businesses. It collects worker availability and business demand, then schedules workers according to labor rules. Businesses save money by regaining time spent scheduling, utilizing more efficient schedules, and maintaining compliance.
