Last week I presented the talk *Overview of Programming Languages* at [Hackership.co](http://hackership.co) in Berkeley. The 30-minute talk introduces beginning programmers to the differences between programming languages. The original post about the talk was [here](/overview-of-programming-languages/). My next talk is about [optimization in Julia at the OpenLate Meetup Group](http://www.meetup.com/OpenLate/events/208535152/).
