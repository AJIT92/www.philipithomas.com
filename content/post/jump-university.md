Last year I gave a [presentation about optimization in the Julia programming language using JuMP](/video-optimization-in-julia/) at the [OpenLate meetup](http://meetup.com/openlate/). This week I received an email about that video from a professor at the University Carlos III in Madrid that I want to share:

> I am preparing some OR courses for the next semester and, after watching
your wonderful [JuMP tutorial](https://www.philipithomas.com/video-optimization-in-julia/) I have
decided to use JuMP in my courses. I have been traditionally using GAMS
for my research but now I am moving to JuMP and Julia as well. Thanks!

I advocate [JuMP](http://juliaopt.org) for its simplicity and maintainability. My project [StaffJoy](https://www.StaffJoy) relies heavily on the parallel features of Julia and integer programming features of JuMP, with which we currently schedule over a thousand shifts per week. My optimization coursework in college was mostly in Excel and GAMS, so it excites me to see JuMP displacing legacy software in the academic world.
