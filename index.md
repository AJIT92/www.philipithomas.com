I live in San Francisco where I work as an engineer at [OpenDNS](https://www.opendns.com). Currently I distributed caching caching infrastructure and data processing systems. I graduated in 2013 from Washington University in St. Louis with majors in Systems Engineering and Physics. I started and run the [OpenLate Meetup Group](http://meetup.com/openlate) for engineers in the San Francisco Bay. I spend most of my free time working on [StaffJoy](https://www.staffjoy.com), a tool that decreases labor costs using artificial intelligence. For fun I practice [Krav Maga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krav_Maga), [salsa dance](/salsa-videos/), and [read](http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/29928602-philip-i-thomas?shelf=read&sort=date_read).
