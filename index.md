I am building [StaffJoy](https://www.staffjoy.com), a workforce intelligence company that helps businesses control labor costs. Previously, I spent two and a half years engineering data systems at [OpenDNS](https://www.opendns.com) until its [acquisition by Cisco](/opendns-acquisition/). I am a 2013 graduate of Washington University in St. Louis, where I received majors in Systems Engineering and Physics. For fun I study [Krav Maga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krav_Maga), [salsa dance](/salsa-videos/), and [read](http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/29928602-philip-i-thomas?shelf=read&sort=date_read).
