I live in San Francisco where I build data tools at [OpenDNS](https://www.opendns.com), which was [recently acquired by Cisco](/opendns-acquisition/). My current project is a client software orchestration system called Floodgate. On the side, I co-founded a company called [StaffJoy](https://www.staffjoy.com) that decreases labor costs by scheduling hourly employees to fulfill business demand.

I started and run the [OpenLate Meetup Group](http://meetup.com/openlate) with 1800 technical members in San Francisco. In addition, I am a Level 3 student of [Krav Maga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krav_Maga). For fun I [salsa dance](/salsa-videos/), [write](/writing/), and [read](http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/29928602-philip-i-thomas?shelf=read&sort=date_read).

I graduated in 2013 from Washington University in St. Louis with majors in Systems Engineering and Physics. My senior project focused on a novel approach to workforce scheduling with applied mathematics.
