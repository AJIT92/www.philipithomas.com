Scotch whiskey by law must be made from malted barley, must be aged in an oak cask for at least three years, and must be produced in Scotland. The drink is sophisticated and strong and is characterized by its smoky accents that result from peat, which is a moss-like fungus that is burned to flavor the barley. The distillery Glenmorangie, based in Tain, Ross-Shire, Scotland has taken an unconventional approach with their Nectar D'Or scotch. They take scotch that has been aged in a bourbon oak cask for ten years and then age it in a French Sauterne cask for another two years. This adds a sweet and wine-like accent to the drink.

Glenmorangie Nector D'Or has a solid basic scotch flavor, which is augmented by the sauternes cask to create an accessible and delicious whiskey that satisfies a range of palates. The smell lacks harshness and more resembles the sauterne French dessert wine from which its casks originate than other Scottish whiskeys. The resulting flavor has a subdued peet that serves as an undertone to the mild smokiness from the bourbon cask and the predominant sweetness and vanilla from the sauternes. The taste has a hint of honey with citrus acidity that smoothly complements the sweetness for a full, balanced flavor.

The balanced and reserved flavor of this whiskey makes it accessible for those less accustomed to neat whiskey, while its uniqueness will appease those with more experienced palates. At about $65 a bottle of Glenmorangie Nectar D'Or is rather affordable, compared to other artisan whiskies. This scotch exemplifies the category of liquor that we strive to share on this blog: it can be appreciated by those unfamiliar with scotch, but retains complexity for those who are experts in Scottish whiskeys.
