India Pale Ales originated among English colonists. English breweries fortified their beers with additional hops so that the brews would not go stale during the long journey to India. It is said that, in 1827, a ship containing several hundred casks of Bass’s East India Pale Ale was wrecked off the coast of Liverpool. Some of the beer was pulled out of the water, and distributed locally. India Pale Ales became immediately popular in England, and these strong hoppy beers continued to be brewed and are distributed worldwide. Dogfish Head Craft Brewery is based in Milton, Delaware where they have made a name for themselves brewing IPAs. Their line has three primary IPAs named for the time each beer is brewed with the hops – the 60 Minute, 90 Minute and 120 Minute styles. With increasing brew time comes a more potent and developed flavor along with a higher ABV.

When smelling and tasting the Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA, the first word that comes to mind is “colorful.” The beer has a sweet, citrusy smell and the initial flavor is a bright mixture of strong bitterness from the hops and thick sweetness from the barley. After the initial onslaught to your palate, the beer’s flavor subsides quickly, leaving a pleasant and satisfying aftertaste of hops. While the flavors are strong, the balance of the bitterness and sweetness shows the talent of the brewers.

The 90 Minute IPA is thick and is almost a meal in and of itself – pairing it with food is difficult, so we tend to have it as an after-dinner snack. While strong, it is important to note that the flavor is not overwhelming and one may have multiple bottles of it in a sitting. Palates unaccustomed to stronger beers will have trouble appreciating the intricacies of the 90 Minute and may wish to start with the 60 Minute IPA or Sierra Nevada Torpedo beers to get used to strong IPAs. Because of this, the 90 Minute IPA is a beer that we tend to hoard for ourselves due to the fear that those served it will not appreciate its developed flavor. However, those who know their beer will recognize this brew as an IPA on steroids made for lovers of this style of beer.
