If the bitterness of India Pale Ales deters some drinkers, then only the most dedicated and hardcore palates enjoy double IPAs, which undergo fermentation twice for more concentrated flavor and alcohol. Among DIPAs, there appears to be a group of brews that dominate not only quality but also availability. <a href="{% post_url 2011-03-19-sierra-nevada-pale-ale-a-benchmark-beer %}">Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA </a> and Stone Ruination IPA seem to lead the pack at the intersection of quality and availability. Today, I assert that Founders Double Trouble deserves to stand among the leaders of the DIPA pack due to its complexity and ease of access. 

Founders was founded in 1997 in Grand Rapids, Michigan by two college graduates with a passion for homebrewing. Their beers became enormously popular, with limited annual releases of their Kentucky Breakfast Stout reaching cult status in the beer community. Like many other popular breweries such as Dogfish Head and Stone, they are expanding production with the goal of higher accessibility in more states. The brewery is quite involved in the Grand Rapids community in a variety of ways, the culmination being their Founders Fest. Founders Fest is an annual celebration of the community, music, and beer  hosted by Founders. Their 2011 fest occurs tomorrow and is a pilgrimage for many lovers of beer.

When poured, Founders Double Trouble yields little head and has a light color. In contrast, the beer has a considerable amount of lacing which creates an entertaining feeling in the mouth. The smell is melon and honey with classic pine and hops, which mixes in an enticing way that makes for one of the best aromas for a beer that I have experienced. Upon tasting, the beer displays a punch of hops with a burn on the back-end that is complemented by a lingering hint of spice. The bitterness in the aftertaste soothes tongue and is followed by a light, toasty caramel from the malt that is reminiscent of a good bread crust. While a classic IPA presents pine and hops smell with a good bitterness, the Double Trouble augments the flavor with a toasty malt that is not overly sweet, a melon smell that is quite unique, and a spice flavor that would not be considered a pure IPA component. Overall, this Double Trouble shines as a DIPA because it pays homage to classic style but adds unique and unconventional flare with its alluring smell and elevated flavor.

The most astounding part of the Double Trouble that it remains a smooth and consumable beer. It may be a double IPA with double the alcohol of a mainstream beer and double the bitterness of a pale ale, but the experience is not overwhelming. With summer heat upon us, Double Trouble is a beer I envision drinking while relaxing on the patio with a good book.  In conclusion, Founders Double Trouble entertains its drinkers with flavors that delights the palate without assaulting it, resulting in a craft brew that is simply a damn good DIPA.
