What lies behind the articles, books, and ads that we read every day? To dive more into the world of writing, I read books that share different views, from instructive to insightful, of the written word.

## Language Intelligence: Lessons on persuasion from Jesus, Shakespeare, Lincoln, and Lady Gaga
### Perspective: Persuasion


<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1477452222/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1477452222&linkCode=as2&tag=sagacionlook-20"><img alt="Language Intelligence" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=1477452222&Format=_SL110_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=sagacionlook-20" class="img-float" ></a>

[Language Intelligence](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1477452222/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1477452222&linkCode=as2&tag=sagacionlook-20) shares techniques to make communication eloquent and persuasive. When I was a competition extemporaneous speaker, I learned to give organized speeches about politics that aimed to persuade judges. While reading Language Intelligence, I realized that the lessons in the book were all of the strategies I had been trained to use in speaking competitions. 

By picking apart famous Presidential speeches, biblical passages, and Shakespeare acts, the book explains techniques to optimize writing. In particular, the author focuses on simple diction, repetition, figures of speech, and extended metaphors to grasp attention, hold it, and influence the reader. 

> Orators who remember to use chiasmus will be remembered as orators. 

Some of the strategies presented may seem intuitive - such as "use simple words" - but, through the analysis presented, you realize that few actually practice these techniques. I found myself rewriting everything from my LinkedIn profile to engineering memos using the techniques presented to make them more accessible. I even realized that some corporate notes containing bad news about things like consumer information leaks were intentionally misusing these strategies to disinterest readers. 

Language Intelligence is a lesson in writing for the "real world." It has changed the way I approach communication, and I find myself suggesting it to people multiple times per week. 

## Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life
### Perspective: Culture


<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385480016/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0385480016&linkCode=as2&tag=sagacionlook-20"><img src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0385480016&Format=_SL110_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=sagacionlook-20" class="img-float" alt="Bird by Bird" ></a>

[Bird by Bird](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385480016/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0385480016&linkCode=as2&tag=sagacionlook-20) presents a window into the mind of a cynical writer that everybody imagines their favorite authors to be. The author shares the account of her sitcom-like life as a professional writer. Because of the fun it pokes at everything from editors to literary schadenfreude, writers have formed a cult following for the book. 

>  “When I write, I feel like an armless legless man with a crayon in his mouth.” -Kurt Vonnegut

The book reminded me of Anthony Bourdain's book Kitchen Confidential, which documented the raw, hard life of professional cooking. The value in Bird by Bird for me was how authentically it shares a life that few lead but so many directly support.

If you should eat where the chefs eat, then perhaps consider reading the book that writers read - Bird by Bird.

## The Little Blue Book: The Essential Guide to Thinking and Talking Democratic
### Perspective: Politics


<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/147670001X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=147670001X&linkCode=as2&tag=sagacionlook-20"><img alt="Bird by Bird" class="img-float" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=147670001X&Format=_SL110_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=sagacionlook-20" ></a>
After reading Language Intelligence, [The Little Blue Book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/147670001X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=147670001X&linkCode=as2&tag=sagacionlook-20) caught my eye as a more applied lesson on rhetoric. Little Blue Book is a book written for Democrats to improve their communication skills. The authors tear apart all modern political messaging to analyze how it works. He then shows how the Democratic Party has essentially failed at marketing by not proactively managing their language.

> "I am not a member of any organized political party. I am a Democrat." -Will Rogers

Topics covered in the book include farm subsidies, healthcare, and abortion. For each of these, the author analyzes messaging and debate points. For instance, the case is made for calling healthcare legislation "Medicare for All" rather than a "Single Payer System."

What caught my attention was not the focus of the book on Democrats, but the analysis of rhetoric in practice. It clearly explains that reactive strategies - for instance, rebutting "Pro Life" campaigns with "Pro Choice" campaigns - is already a losing battle because you re-use the titles developed by your opponents and thus lend credibility to that which you oppose.  

I found myself being able to look at political ads and to analyze them impartially based on their language due to the  insight from this book. If you follow politics, reading Little Blue Book will give you deeper insight into the deeper workings of politics.

## The Science Writers' Handbook: Everything You Need to Know to Pitch, Publish, and Prosper in the Digital Age
### Perspective: Journalism 

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0738216569/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0738216569&linkCode=as2&tag=sagacionlook-20"><img src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0738216569&Format=_SL110_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=sagacionlook-20" alt="Science Writers Handbook" class="img-float"></a>
Looking for a change in writing books, I stumbled upon [The Science Writers' Handbook](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0738216569/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0738216569&linkCode=as2&tag=sagacionlook-20). While I expected a book about technical communication for scientists, I found an introduction to the lifestyle of professional science reporters and journalists. 

> Our common mission is to explain very complicated things with both maximum simplicity and maximum accuracy.

The handbook shares insight on professional freelance journalism, and only slightly touches the science portion. Rather than focusing on writing, the book is a guide to the business of professional writing, including topics like interviewing, networking, contract negotiation, and accounting. 

To learn about the world of proposals, deadlines, word counts, and editing that goes into the media, read the Science Writers' Handbook.
