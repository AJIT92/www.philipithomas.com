title: The Basics of Your First Website
summary: How to create and set up a personal homepage or blog.
---

Friends and family often ask me about how to set up a personal website or blog. After writing or explaining my thoughts many times, I decided to sit down and write out my full recommendations. 

# Step 1: Domain

The first step to a professional website is buying the domain. Domains are what you see in your address bar - like *example.com* or *brouhaha.io*. Owning a domain basically gives you control where people go when they look up that address. Here, it means that you can direct them to a website, but it even means that you can control how email sent to the domain works. The domain is how people get to your website - it is not the website itself.

Owning a domain name is cheap - about $10/year, but the popular extensions like .com have many of the best options taken. So, you have to be creative, or use a less-known extension like *.io*. 

Here are a couple of my friend's domains, for creative inspiration:

* [AndHess.com](http://www.andhess.com/)
* [DrewCase.com](http://drewcase.com/)
* [TonyTangFromToronto.com](http://www.tonytangfromtoronto.com)
* [philipithomas.com](https://www.philipithomas.com) <small class="muted">(Oh wait, that's me)</small>

For where to search and purchase domains, I suggest [Namecheap](http://www.namecheap.com/?aff=59414). If you are looking for more obscure extensions, [Gandi](http://gandi.net) is your best choice. 

# Step 2 - Server and Software

Now that you own the domain, you a way to build and publish the website. 

## About.Me - Bare Minimum

<a href="http://about.me"><img src="/images/first-website/aboutme.jpg" class="full" alt="About.me"/></a>

If you just want a website you control with your face and ways to contact you, [About.Me](http://about.me) is your best choice. For $4/month, you can use your domain to host a beautiful personal homepage with information about you and links to your social media accounts. You don't have much content control - don't expect more than a sentence or two of writing room, let alone multiple pages or a blog - but you can control the site with their [iPhone app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/about.me/id500230347). 

Good: 

* Beautiful
* Easy to control

Bad:

* Almost no customization


## Squarespace - Customization Without Code

[Squarespace](http://www.squarespace.com) is the option I would suggest for most beginners. At $10/month, it is not the cheapest, but it is the most powerful and customizable solution for building a website without needing to know code. If you prepay for a year, not only does the price decrease, but you get a domain for free.

What makes the interface so powerful is that, after selecting from professional templates, you can fidget with every single part of the website, from the color of a button to the width of a column with ease. Creating a blog or a gallery with Squarespace is straightforward, and they offer a [slew of wonderful iOS apps](http://www.squarespace.com/apps/).

Good:

* Precise control
* Easy to use

Bad:

* Expensive
* Starts to lack technical control

<h3>Wordpress - A Quick Lesson</h3>
<img class="img-float" src="/images/first-website/wordpress.png" alt="Wordpress"/>
<p>You have probably heard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress">Wordpress</a> - it is a free, community-supported piece of software that powers about a fifth of all web traffic in the world. The software makes running a blog or general website straightforward. It can be installed on basically any server, and it has a community of themes and plugins to add nearly infinite power. The <a href="http://wpiphone.wordpress.com/">Wordpress iPhone App</a> gives you basic control of almost any Wordpress installation. </p>

<h5>The dangers of Wordpress:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Because it's easy to set up, it is easy to set up incorrectly. This can mean getting hacked or losing all of your data. </li>
<li> Unless you plan to make it fast, Wordpress can get really slow, really quickly. When links on the front page of Reddit don't work, it's probably because the server didn't configure Wordpress to scale, so the whole server crashed when too many people looked at the site. </li>
<li>Plugins and themes are abound - but not are all good. Some contain viruses or tracking code that can infect or steal information from your server. Others are not up-to-date and can unintentionally make your server open to attack. </li>
<li>Maintenance on Wordpress can be difficult - whether you run into a technical problem or accidentally delete the wrong thing, fixing the problem can sometimes take a professional programmer an hour to figure out. </li>
</ul>

<p>Having warned you about the dangers, difficulties, and frustrations of Wordpress, it is the most powerful and extensible website tool. If you know what you're doing, it's also cheap. </p>

## Digital Ocean - DIY Wordpress

Having stated why I didn't make Wordpress my first recommendation, if you insist on trying it out, I suggest using [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=005373966733), which offers servers from $5/month. Digital Ocean hosting is known as simple, secure, and affordable. Best of all, they offer a simple tool for installing Wordpress so that you do not need to mess around with databases and transferring files. If your server is slow, you can manage its size from the web or their [iPhone app](https://itunes.apple.com/app/digitalocean-manager/id633128302). 

Note, though, that security will not be perfect, and that maintenance and troubleshooting may require Google prowess and some technical knowledge.

Good:

* 1-click install
* Scale server size to need

Negatives:

* Security considerations
* Requires technical knowledge

## WPEngine - Wordpress for Pros

To use Wordpress without having to worry about speed, scaling, or maintenance, check out [WPEngine](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=394686&u=680358&m=41388&urllink=&afftrack=). They provide a *managed* Wordpress service where they host and maintain your Wordpress installation. At $30/month it is not cheap, but having somebody to make Wordpress behave nicely and fix your problems when they arise is sometimes worth the money. It is the choice of many professionals who are tired of wasting time debugging little issues or optimizing speed. If you want Wordpress without the headache, check out WPEngine.

Good:

* Wordpress without the guess work

Bad:

* Expensive



## Bonus - Ghost on Digital Ocean
<a href="http://ghost.org"><img src="/images/first-website/ghost.jpg" alt="Ghost" class="full"/></a>

If Wordpress sounds like a bloated, dangerous, overly-complicated monster, that's because it is. The community recognized this and started a [Kickstarter campaign to build a better blogging system](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform). They raised over $300,000 USD, and last month the first version of [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) launched. Like Wordpress, it is just a free piece of software, but it is faster and simpler. At the moment the software is quite new - it doesn't even support non-blog pages like an "about" - but the interface is wonderful and easy-to-use. Currently, [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=005373966733) supports one-click installation of Ghost, and I suggest trying it out if you just want a blog that is easy to use. 

## Conclusion

If you want a personal website and blog, In general I suggest [Squarespace](http://squarespace.com) as your starting point. If you need a more extensible solution, you'll eventually end up on Wordpress - and I apologize in advance for the headaches it will cause. In a month or two, when Ghost matures, it will probably be my main recommendation.
