Wine connoisseurs pay much respect to the type of glass used. True vinophiles can spend over <a href="http://glassware.riedel.com/index.php/riedel/sommeliers/bordeaux-grand-cru-wine-glass.html">$100 per glass</a> for a crafted tool that properly delivers the underlying aromas of a specific varietal. When first beginning in the beer world, it is easy to stick with the venerable and affordable pint glass for consuming different beers, but it is important to note that the brew delivery device can drastically alter the tasting experience. Specifically, the shape of the glass affects the head development, head retention, nose, and lacing of the beer.

Two dramatic differences exist in glassware between the wine world and the beer world. The first is the glass price. While exceptions occur, most craft beer enthusiasts rely on a glass that costs under $8, whereas wine connoisseurs in general purchase more expensive glasses as their ability to detect different flavors develops. The second major difference is that, whereas most wine glasses are made by dedicated glassware companies that produce a variety of glasses each optimized for specific grapes, beer glasses are often designed and sold by breweries for particular brews. This is done to both provide the vessel that best showcases their beer and to provide a souvenir-like advertisement. With beers such as Duvel, Samuel Adams Boston Lager, or Delerium Tremens, the respective breweries made the effort to design a custom glass with the style, shape, and nucleation points to best frame a particular beer. For the drinker, this takes some of the guesswork out of the process of selecting a beer glass, even if it means just using the shape of the brewery glass to select the closest match from your collection. The glass at hand today, the Duvel tulip, while made for the Duvel Belgian ale, is a versatile, sturdy, affordable, and well-respected piece of glassware that should be a part of your beer tasting rituals.

I <a href="{% post_url 2011-05-12-dogfish-head-signature-glass %}">previously stated</a> that I love collecting glassware, so when a 4-pack of Duvel beer with their signature glass was only two dollars more than the standard 4-pack, I found the marginal cost easily justifiable. In one’s hand, the glass is large, sturdy, and masculine, albeit nearly to the point of clunkiness. The logo on the side remains unobtrusive and clean, so I serve many different beers from this glass. In fact, I estimate that half of my beer tastings have been from one of these glasses. The tulip shape is classically Belgian and the flare of the bulb makes it ideally suited for beers with a high ABV such as barleywines, imperial IPAs, and Belgian ales because it concentrates the intricate flavors for the nose to dissect and encourages better head development and retention in these less foamy beers.  However, Hefeweisens and sours should be avoided in tulip glasses because they lose carbonation too quickly.

When poured, beer in the Duvel glass develops a solid head, and the volume of the glass is sufficient so that the glass can comfortably accommodate a standard 12-ounce beer with a thick head while still leaving space at the top in which to stick one’s nose. It is difficult to spill from due to the size and stable base. The shape causes the glass to capture scents well and allows for pedantic dissection of underlying flavors, or just can help you to enjoy the better qualities of your favorite brew. On the bottom of the glass is a laser-engraved “D” that serves as a nucleation point to improve lacing and head retention - I am always amused by the bubbles rising from it as I pour a beer. This works by breaking up the surface tension of the beer and giving the bubbles a place to form - in a smooth glass, bubbles would be larger and would not form as easily. The glass indeed lives up to its style and maintains a solid head during drinking.

In terms of design, the Duvel tulip feels substantial due to its thickness and weight, and I have never broken one, even after dropping it a few times. While a characteristic often overlooked, the mouth is wide enough so that one can wash the inside. This makes it quite usable. Many BeerAdvocate and RateBeer contributors regard this a benchmark piece of glassware. At only $4 a stem, I consider this an accessible and high-quality piece. It has been my steadfast companion through many beers and its passive role has improved and enlivened many brews.
