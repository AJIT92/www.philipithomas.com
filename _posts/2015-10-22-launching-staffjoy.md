Today I'm excited to announce that we are launching [Staffjoy](https://www.staffjoy.com) from the [YCombinator Fellowship](http://fellowship.ycombinator.com). Staffjoy provides the first workforce tool that builds schedules entirely automatically, while respecting worker preferences and not requiring human scheduler. The web app collects worker availability and business demand, and then schedules workers according to their preferences, as well as the businessâ€™s rules. Businesses save money by regaining time spent scheduling, as they utilize the more efficient schedules.
