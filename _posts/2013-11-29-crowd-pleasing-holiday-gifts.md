title: Crowd-Pleasing Holiday Gifts 
summary: Gift ideas from crowdfunding campaigns
---

Crowdfunding popularized itself in 2012 as a way for anybody to support new products and projects by contributing on websites such as [Kickstarter](http://kickstarter.com) and [Indiegogo](http://indiegogo.com). Companies like [Pebble](https://getpebble.com/) were able to raise millions of dollars, but it was not until this year that many of these mega-projects completed their crowdfunding goal: delivering the finished products to their supporters. Now, many of these successful projects are available in the general market, all because of the generous support of initial backers.

When looking for holiday gift ideas, I turned to "the crowd" for democratized advice. Below, I have compiled holiday gifts ideas that have their roots in crowdfunding.

## [Pebble](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AYDNRNA/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00AYDNRNA&linkCode=as2&tag=sagacionlook-20) ($250)

Pebble, in some ways, kickstarted the crowdfunding community. When its founders set out to raise $100,000 to develop a "smart watch" that synced with smartphones, their campaign went viral and raised over $10 million.

Now in mass production, Pebble watches are available for anybody to purchase.

## [Keysmart](http://getkeysmart.com/) ($20)

Keysmart designed a simple product to replace clunky, loud keyrings with a sleek, minimal device. After a [successful Kickstarter campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2065501355/smartkey-free-your-pocket), Keysmart just began sales to the general public. It is one of those gadgets that made me say, "This would be a great gift, but first I want one!"

## [Biosand Filter](http://www.charitywater.org/cambodia/) ($65)
 
While not a traditional "crowd-sourced" product, [Charity: Water](http://www.charitywater.org) is a nonprofit that uses technology in unique ways. Through partnerships with companies like Google and Cisco, 100% of all donations are used directly in clean-water projects. Their technology platform allows individuals to lead their own funding campaigns, then track the construction and use of their projects. With technology provided by Google, well donors can even track how much clean water their well has provided. Gifting a [biosand filter through Charity: Water](http://www.charitywater.org/cambodia) provides a family in Cambodia with clean drinking water, and you can use the Charity: Water platform to lead your own campaign.

## [Keybit Magsafe Adapter Keyring](http://bitwise-design.com/) ($15)

The Keybit keychain was created to solve a simple problem: new Apple laptops have a different power adapter, and using old charging cables with new laptops requires a tiny, easy-to-lose [adapter](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008ALAHA4/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B008ALAHA4&linkCode=as2&tag=sagacionlook-20). To carry this adapter, Jonathan Bobrow designed a keychain that the magnetic adapter would snap onto. 

The crowdfunding portion was not his initial step, though - he offered the keychain on a website called [Shapeways](http://www.shapeways.com/model/956722/keybit-magsafe-adapter-key-ring-beta.html?li=productBox-search), which would 3D print a keychain every time one was ordered. Demand was so overwhelming that 3D printing each individual keychain was inefficient and expensive. 

So, this year Jonathan launched and completed a [Kickstarter campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1059262388/keybit-magsafe-adapter-key-ring) to mass-manufacture the keychains, which he branded Keybit. These new mass-produced keychains are [now available](http://bitwise-design.com/), and are a great gift for any Macbook-wielding tech geek.

## [Coin](https://onlycoin.com/?referral=EHmgdLcS) ($50)

Coin launched a campaign this month to create a device that stores all of a user's credit cards, thus replacing a card-filled wallet with a single Coin. The response was overwhelming - the company hit its $10,000 preorder goal within 40 minutes of launching. The campaign is continuing with strength, and [preorders are still available](http://bitwise-design.com/) until mid-December. While Coin does not plan on shipping devices until next Summer, it is a trendy gift with true crowdfunding spirit.
