Since its relatively recent inception in 1997, Founders Brewing Company has established itself as one of the foremost craft breweries in the world, having been ranked fourth in the world by Ratebeer.com and having won numerous medals at world beer competitions. The brewery is located in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and is famous for their Kentucky Breakfast Stout, which consistently ranks among the top ten beers ever produced according to Beer Advocate and Ratebeer.com. Fortunately, their mainstream offerings stand on par with other craft breweries in terms of price and availability, while retaining a notable quality and uniqueness that make them well-worth pursuing. With their Porter, Founders has taken a classic style porter, and elevated it by adding a rich and smooth bitterness.

When first looking at the label of the Founders Porter, one notices that the alcohol content is slightly higher than typical porters. The beer has a deep and dark color, which is complemented by its rich and fulfilling aroma of roasted coffee and mild chocolate. The taste is silky and has a base of coffee that is markedly similar to the aroma. The flavor is aggrandized by a relatively high bitterness measuring at 45 IBUs, relative to a standard 29 IBUs for porters and 37 IBUs for Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, that rounds out the brew into a tangy and drinkable porter. Notably, there is no iron aftertaste that is often found in more inferior porters. The beer is complex and delicious in a way that entertains the palate from start to finish.

The Founders Porter is not a classic style porter like the Samuel Smith Taddy Porter. Instead, it incorporates a modern twist by way of bitter accents onto the classic that remain accessible to beginners. However, those who have already dipped their toes into the porter arena, and especially those who enjoy the bitterness of pale ales will appreciate the porter. The Founders Porter is a powerful interpretation of a classic style and is, at its root, a quality beer.
