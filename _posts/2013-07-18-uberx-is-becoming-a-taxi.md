San Francisco-based Uber became famous for providing on-demand black car transportation. In 39 cities worldwide, with the click of a button, a clean luxury car would pick you up, the driver would be professional, and billing was handled unobtrusively through the iPhone app. Recently, Uber has made an effort to provide a [low-cost option in all of its markets](http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/07/uber-wants-to-offer-a-low-cost-option-in-all-of-its-markets/). The campaign focuses on UberX, which provides the same convenience of Uber, but with primarily hybrid vehicles and lower costs. [In San Francisco](http://blog.uber.com/2013/06/11/uberx-cheaper-than-a-taxi/), the service is being marketed as "<span class="">Better, Faster, and Cheaper than a Taxi.</span>" Unfortunately, while onboarding so many UberX drivers, the <span class="highlight">service level is declining to taxi-like levels.</span> 

UberX used to be quite good - looking at my historical combined Uber/UberX ratings, out of my first 24 rides, I rated only one driver less than 4 stars. That driver stunk of marijuana, and I considered the experience an anomaly. In the last 4 weeks, though, I have noticed a string of bad UberX experiences. 

Unlike Uber or a taxi, it takes no special certifications to become an UberX driver. As UberX has scaled and onboarded more cars, it has become commonplace to have drivers with no professional driving experience, and hence near zero knowledge of the city. Having a driver use a GPS to get to your destination has become common, even if it is a simple destination like "the caltrain station in SOMA." In fact, I was recently picked up by an UberX driver who did not know what "The Mission" was. 

Drivers are also becoming more aware of their ratings, becuase Uber terminates drivers once their rating dips below a particular threshhod. As I exit the UberX, it has become more commonplace to hear "please rate me 5 stars if you enjoyed my service." I had a low yesterday when I was picked up by an UberX driver with a 4.3 star rating. A couple blocks from my destination, he ended the fare and told me that he did it to save me money. He then asked me to rate him 5 stars while I was still in the car, and asked me to confirm that I had submitted the rating. The strategy seemed a bit menacing because [drivers see your ratings](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/04/13/in-case-you-didnt-know-uber-drivers-see-how-many-stars-you-gave-them/). 

While riding in an UberX this morning, for the first time I had an UberX driver talk on his cell phone during the ride. It was this that prompted me to realize that UberX quality has been consistently going downward, and that it is becoming no better than a taxi in terms of professionalism and quality. 

Uber became popular because it took the guessing work out of transportation. There were no doubts about driver professionalism, ride quality, or billing. Unfortunately, in an effort to compete with taxis, UberX is gaining the characteristics that make taxis so undesirable.
