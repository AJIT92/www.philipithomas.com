During a friend's recent visit to San Francisco, we sought to get away from the typical tourist commotion and into more authentic San Francisco culture. We ended up in The Mission district at a highly profitable technology company that is a bit taboo - but made for an exciting afternoon tour. We visited the 200,000 square foot [SF Armory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Armory) - home and studios of the world's largest fetish pornography website, Kink.com.

## History

The US National Guard constructed the castle-like complex just prior to World War I to serve as an armory and arsenal. The building consists of a four-floor administration building with basement and a massive drill court that was later enclosed. Between World War I and World War II, the drill court served as the main sports venue in San Francisco, and it housed weekly boxing prizefights. The US Military vacated the building in 1976. Around that time, George Lucas used the drill court to film space battle scenes for his upcoming film, Star Wars. 

The building fell into disrepair for the following three decades, until 2007 when an entrepreneur from New York named [Peter Acworth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Acworth) purchased the building for $14.5 million through his fetish pornography company, Kink.com. A brick castle in San Francisco was almost too perfect a venue for his company. 

Today, the SF Armory houses 70 studios, administrative offices, a substantial art department, and event space. [Tours of the building are offered most days for $25/person](http://www.armorystudios.com/san-francisco-tours/). 


## Tour 

The [Mission District](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_District,_San_Francisco) is one of San Francisco's most exciting neighborhoods. In addition to strong culture, it features some of the city's most famous restaurants, bars, and coffee shops. Right in the middle of everyday life for the urban neighborhood's residents is a massive brick castle. Most locals know the current use of the building, but an air of mysteriousness still surrounds the location. 

Ultimately, curiosity about the SF armory and its activities drove us to purchase tickets for a tour on a Sunday afternoon. We didn't know what to expect - the [SF Armory website](http://www.armorystudios.com/san-francisco-tours/) gives the impression that the tour focuses on showcasing the historic building.

We showed up for the tour and were ushered into a waiting room after signing safety waivers. Vending machines, first aid kits, refrigerators, a popcorn machine, and paintings of naked people lined the walls. As our tour guide entered, she invited us to sit on old-looking couches in the middle of the room that faced a projector. 

The guide gave a short history of the building, then dove into the real purpose of our tour. "My goal is to introduce everybody here to alternative sexualities and answer your questions as we tour the functioning porn studios of Kink.com." We quickly learned that our tour guide was one of the most veteran stars of Kink.com, and that the tour would be anything but ordinary. 

The tour began in the 68,000 square foot basement. The number of first aid kits lining the walls concerned me a bit. As we entered the first of many film studios, our guide pointed out the metal rings bolted to the walls. "These are for tying people up. They are everywhere."

Many of the studios used the existing features of the armory - mainly the dark, dungeon-like rooms with brick walls - and just added lights and metal rings on the walls before calling them production-ready. More elaborate sets were built in other rooms. One was a full apartment - only, the faucet didn't work, and there were metal rings bolted to the walls. Members of the group whispered "Whoa, this the largest apartment I've seen in this neighborhood!" Other sets were more elaborate, like a a padded room with one-way glass, or a futuristic sci-fi set.

The tour group members and their interactions with our guide were what really made the two-hour tour fun. My favorite members of the group were an older couple donning fanny packs. They were clearly just following their guide book during a trip to the city and seemed a bit out-of-place. Many looks were exchanged between other members of the group as they asked questions like, "So can you explain again how this contraption for locking a person's head to the floor works?" Our tour guide fondly pointed out that it was for "advanced models" like herself. 

The most entertaining portion of the tour was the warehouse of props. Everything from rocking chairs to human-sized hamster wheels lined the shelves. In the back was a room of whips, gags, and other odd contraptions that smelled of disinfectant. 45-gallon drums of lubricant sat next to buckets.

On the top floor of the armory, we were showed the community spaces, where Kink.com give demonstrations and workshops. In addition, the space is used for elaborate parties by the San Francisco fetish community, which are dotted with professional models and broadcasted live through webcams. It was also around this time that we learned more than we expected about other group members as they began eagerly inquiring about how to be invited to these events. 

The tour concluded with a look at the drill court, which is reputed to be the largest unsupported enclosed space in San Francisco. Having undergone extensive rennovations this past year, Kink.com plans to open the area as a community center. Thinking of children playing basketball in the space seemed odd, considering the daily activities in the adjacent dungeons, but it is nice to see the company giving back to the neighborhood.

## Thoughts

While I expected an overview of the history of a San Francisco landmark, I should have reasonably expected more from a functioning pornography studio. While this tour is not for everybody, approaching the SF Armory with an open mind can provide glimpse into a vibrant culture in San Francisco that few explore. For a technology-focused city, it is hard to ignore the very real profits of this company. 

If you're looking to get away from the bland Wharf and deeper into the freedom that really defines San Francisco culture, consider a [tour of the SF Armory](www.armorystudios.com/san-francisco-tours/) in the Mission.
