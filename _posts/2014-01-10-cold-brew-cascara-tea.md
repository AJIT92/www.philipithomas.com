title: Cold Brew Experiment 3 - Cascara Tea
description: Beverage from the Cherry of Coffee Plants.
category: essay
---

This week I stumbled upon an unusual item - cascara tea. Cascara is not technically a tea, but rather a dried berry from the coffee plant. In coffee-growing areas, it is commonly brewed like tea into a lightly-caffeinated hot beverage. This fruit is rarely exported, so when I came across a tin I had to try preparing it with my favorite method - cold brewing.

## A Brief History of Coffee 

Coffee starts life as a plant in the fields of warm climates. It takes about three years to begin to flower. From these flowers come a small berry with a small coffee bean inside. 

Workers pick these berries when they are ripe and red. Most beans then undergo [wet processing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_production#Wet_process), a commercial process involving much water to remove the berry and outer seed layer using an underwater crushing process. 

In smaller coffee farms, more labor-intensive [dry processing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_production#Dry_process) is used. In dry processing, the ripe beans are dried in the sun for up to 4 weeks. A hulling machine then removes the coffee cherry, which is normally discarded. The resulting green coffee beans are packaged in large burlap bags, where they can remain fresh for years. The green beans are then shipped to roasting facilities around the world. 

At these roasting facilities, coffee beans obtain their characteristic color and smell. Upon being roasted, the beans are only fresh for a week or two. 

## The Discarded Berry

Finding the dried coffee berry, known as Cascara Tea, can be difficult. In San Francisco [Blue Bottle occasionally stocks the tea](http://www.bluebottlecoffee.com/products/tanz-cascara), which they obtain from Aida Batlle's Finca Tanzania farm in El Salvador. 

The "tea" itself looks like large raisins, but the brittle texture feels more like egg shells than dried fruit. The cascara smell sweet like musty grapes and ancho chile. When brewed hot, the beverage is lightly caffeinated, and it has a dark red color like [rooibos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooibos).

## Experiment

To cold brew the Cascara, I opted for the small-batch, jar-based method that I first tried with my [second cold brew experiment](/cold-brew-tea-in-a-jar/). The basic idea is mixing a lot of tea with water in a closed container, leaving it to steep at room temperature overnight, then straining the tea out for a concentrate. 

The tea came in a 50-gram tin, so I tried 5 grams brewed hot, then used the remaining 45 grams for the cold brew.

After steeping overnight, I strained the mixture through a [Chemex filter](

## How It Tastes

The cold-brewed cascara tea smells like raisins and ancho chile. The beverage is mildly oily, and it tastes like grape, citrus, and hibiscus. There is a strong sweetness that reminds you that this is a fruit, not a tea. The finish has mild astringency. Relative to coffee, the beverage is lightly caffeinated. 

This was my first time trying cascara tea, and the results had a distinct taste that was quite different from coffee. The flavor was more complex than I had expected, but it was still not developed and desirable enough to continue brewing in the future. If you find cascara tea, it is a fun change from teas and coffees, but it is not something that I suggest actively seeking.
