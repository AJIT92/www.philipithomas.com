One aspect of the drinking experience that we have yet to expand upon is the venerable equipment of alcohol consumption. Since I first began exploring the world of craft liquor, I have vehemently opposed the use of plastic cups due to their bland and frat party-like nature. Even early in college in my small one-room dorm I had amassed a sufficiently large glassware collection so that a large group of friends could spend the night drinking without having to supplement with disposable cups. Among my glassware, beer glasses receive the most attention. The collection started with Stella Artois chalices and progressed to a variety of glasses suited for different types of beers. A new glass is as fun for me as a new beer because it augments a pragmatic collection, and synergy between the beer and glass can greatly enhance the tasting experience as smell, lacing, and head are improved.

While perusing the Dogfish Head Brewery website, home to one of my favorite makers of craft beers, I came across their signature snifter, a unique-looking hand-blown glass. The craft nature of the glass appealed to me because the glassware distributed by most breweries is mass-produced stamped glass and is designed for consistence and durability during use at a professional bar. Consistency and durability have their place, but in a home environment I prefer something less utilitarian and more aesthetically appealing. Interest piqued, I ordered two of the glasses.

When I first held them I was surprised at their quality construction. The glass grade and thin walls relative to other beer glasses reminded me of quality crystal wine glasses. While the sides are thin, the base is thick, solid glass that lends a sturdy character. Furthermore, the wide opening made washing the glass easy.

Drinking beer out of the Dogfish Head Signature Glass is a quality experience. A full 12 ounces of beer plus reasonable head sit comfortably in the bulb. The glass feels solid in the hand, the shape captures beer aromas well, and the thin walls feel crisp on the lips. The thick base not only improves stable grip but also insulates the beer from the heat of one's hand. Of note, this is a snifter-style glass, similar to those used for brandy. The tapered mouth concentrates smells and makes the glasses best suited for strong beers such as barleywines and imperial IPAs. However, these attributes lend themselves well to a variety of styles of beer and the glass is a versatile part of one's collection. The small Dogfish Head logo laser engraved at the bottom of the glass is both fun and pragmatic because it serves as a nucleation point where bubbles can accumulate, increasing lacing. When drinking a heady beer out of the glass, a stream of bubbles emanating from the logo is readily apparent.

Regrettably, the greatest attribute of this glass is also its worst problem. The unique and artisan properties of the glass are derived from the blown glass manufacturing process - the thin walls, differing characteristics, and bulb shape are determined by the blowing. While variation in shape and quality for each glass can be expected, the differences between the two glasses I purchased were quite substantial. One glass has a curved base, the other is nearly flat and wobbles. Side-by-side, the stems are of different diameters and even curve a bit. The bulbs are substantially different in concavity and the heights of the glasses are a bit different. Curiously, the engraved logos and 12 ounce marker lines on the glasses were at the same height relative to the table. This caused my science background to kick into gear and I conducted quick test to see how precise the 12 ounce marker lines were. Using a Pyrex measuring cup, I poured 12 ounces of dyed water into each glass. The picture to the left shows the results, which are quite surprising. The two glasses differ fairly significantly in volume. This is due to the different shapes of the bulbs resulting from the blowing process.This myriad of differences between only two glasses suggests great inconsistencies in the manufacturing process.

Concerned that I may have received one good glass and a dud, I contacted Dogfish Head to see whether the glasses were consistent with their quality standards. In short, they were. The customer service department explained that they were aware of the problems with the 12 ounce line and were removing them from future glasses but the ones they shipped me were from the old inventory. As for the wobbly base, they wrote "Since the glass is a hand blown piece, each one will be slightly different and unfortunately inconsistencies come with the territory." To me, this is unacceptable. For them to send not only a misshapen glass, but one that wobbles and has a line which incorrectly measures 12 ounces ruins its utilitarian purpose as well as its aesthetic appeal. We can expect some inconsistency with handmade construction, but the piece should still be a workable glass. Furthermore, this shows the lack of oversight or even indifference of the Dogfish Head brewery. Consumers have to risk getting a glass that wobbles and Dogfish Head considers it normal inventory.

In conclusion, I received two glasses from Dogfish Head - one I loved and one I hated. The former would serve as a great addition to one's bar due to its quality construction, appealing aesthetics, and snifter shape that make it well-suited to tasting a variety of beers. The latter is unprofessional refuse from the bowels of Dogfish Head that is unsuitable for serving to guests due to its wobbly base. Because Dogfish Head considers the latter a part of normal production, I cannot recommend the purchase of Dogfish Head Signature Glasses. Only in the case that one examines the glasses in person before buying should they be purchased. In the end, the Dogfish Head Signature Glass is both literally and figuratively an "off-centered glass for off-centered people."
