Tomorrow I am giving a tech talk at a meeting of wute, the Washington University Tech Entrepreneurs, about engineering at [OpenDNS](http://www.opendns.com). The meeting is open to students at [Washington University in St. Louis](http://wustl.edu).

I will be discussing DNS, Big Data, [security research](http://labs.umbrella.com), and careers at OpenDNS. Learn about scaling to 50 billion DNS queries per day, supporting 50 million users, and securing the internet with analysis of terabytes of data.
