> "I think that **cash was Money 1.0**. **Plastic to me is Money 2.0**, and when I say plastic, it’s consumer credit cards and all of the good things that this great country has been built on. And then there’s **Money 3.0, which is, for me, mobile**" - David  Marcus

While grabbing coffee last month, a Paypal representative approached me in line and offered a $5 coupon if I paid using the Paypal iPhone app. I downloaded the app and was set up before I got to the register - only to find that the coffee shop had been unable process phone-based transactions at all that day. "This explains why agile startups like Square and Stripe are taking over the market," I thought. The following week, I saw Paypal President David Marcus speak, and he revised my views of Paypal's innovation, the importance of international support, and the challenges of scaling security.

Payment startups like Square, Stripe, Braintree, and Venmo have made headlines and enamored consumers. However, David made it clear that many of theses startups will have difficulty scaling, and he implied that many would eventually acquired by Papal. When an audience member quipped about using Square to pay for their Starbucks coffee that morning, David was quick to point out that only a small percentage of Starbucks mobile transactions go through Square - the rest go through Paypal. Furthermore, you only get Starbucks rewards if you pay with Paypal. Learning that Paypal processes payments for some of the largest startups, such as Uber, surprised me. So, while my coffee shop failed to process my mobile transaction, the Uber I had taken there was seamlessly processed through Paypal. 

While speaking with an investor from Lyft, a competitor to Uber, I learned that they use Stripe for accepting payments and dispersing driver payouts. Stripe only officially supports in 4 countries, thus either limiting the growth of Lyft or putting a limit on the continued use of Stripe. Meanwhile, Uber has expanded to [26 countries on 5 continents](https://www.uber.com/cities). This growth has been due in part to Paypal. Applications that fail to expand internationally are easy to copy without competition. For instance, the [Samwer Brothers](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-02-29/the-germany-website-copy-machine) have made billions by taking successful US businesses such as Airbnb and Pinterest, then releasing clones to European and Asian markets. Paypal goes to great lengths to avoid limiting your growth potential due to ability to accept payments. 

Payment companies experience growing pains of fraudulent transactions. This is why Paypal markets itself less as a payments company and more as a security company. Accomplishing compliance in a new country is only a first step. Being able to manage risk, handle fraud, and maintain profit becomes the core competency of payment companies. Square already focuses on fraud, but they are [experiencing more issues with more international exposure](http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-20088441-245/researchers-find-avenues-for-fraud-in-square/). The problem has already been predictably managed by Money 2.0 providers such as Visa and Mastercard. Margins, not market, will determine dominance in Money 3.0, and Paypal already is winning in both categories. 

With support for 26 currencies and fraud detection to maintain that scale, Paypal is the king of Money 3.0. While I may quip to my local coffee shop that Square Wallet works more reliably than their Paypal setup, I remained unaware of the countless transactions I had seamlessly completed elsewhere through the Paypal infrastructure.
