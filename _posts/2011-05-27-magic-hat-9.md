Every time I hear the name of Magic Hat  #9, I am reminded of the dissonant Beatles song Revolution 9. Its cacophonous melody well parallels the haphazard flavors of the #9 beer. #9 along with three other beers in a Magic Hat Fall sampler served as my introduction to craft beers long ago. This sampler pack introduced me to the wide variety of beers and hence encouraged me to further explore the beer world. #9 is the best-known and most widely available beer from the Magic Hat Brewery in Burlington, Vermont. As a brewery, Magic Hat offers a revolving and diverse selection of brews, and their seasonal sampler packs offer a fun way to taste a variety of beers. Normally, only one of the four sampler offerings is at all memorable and #9 consistently ranks in the middle of the lineup. In the overall scheme of things, Magic Hat has yet to introduce a single phenomenal beer and hence stays grounded as a more bourgeois craft brewery. #9 is described by the brewery as as a ‘not quite pale ale,’ but in reality it is a lackluster apricot beer with mediocre taste sandwiched between a stale smell and an undesirable aftertaste.

From the bottle, the beer pours a reddish golden color with little head and lacing. The smell primarily features apricot but is accompanied by some sweet malt and a stale wheat undertone that is reminiscent of a cheap pilsner. The taste haphazardly combines low bitterness with more apricot fruit. These flavors are reminiscent of an off-tune cord – additional notes are missing to smoothly harmonize the different flavors. The finish brings a punch of wheat with undesirable iron that leaves a bad memory of this mediocre ale.

Magic Hat #9, while unpolished in flavor development, is not particularly offensive and remains better than most mass-market offerings. Of note, #9 is being introduced in cans this summer, so should you require beer in a can for a concert or the like, this may be the best option among widely available beers. A worthwhile idea is at the core of this brew but Magic Hat failed on its execution. The quirky and adventurous nature of Magic Hat makes the brewery worth exploring, but #9 should be avoided within its lineup. Rather than being ‘not quite a pale ale’ the brew is better described as ‘barely a pale ale with some apricot thrown in.’
