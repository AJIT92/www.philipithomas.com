Our college marketing professor explained that consumers don't want to buy a hammer- they really just want to buy a hole in their wall, and the hammer is a means to that end.

This weekend we are hosting the inaugural [Bayes Impact](http://bayesimpact.org) hackathon at OpenDNS. The event focuses on improving social good using data. The demonstration of civic and social responsibility by the community prompted me to consider how an interconnected world impacts charities. I realized that there exists an opportunity for a "charity clearinghouse" that sells impact rather than just soliciting funds. 

There is an opportunity for the gamification of charities. It's worked for businesses - Kickstarter and Indiegogo have raised billions by gamifying ideas. For non-profits, [charity: water](http://www.charitywater.org/) has successfully applied this strategy to donations by encouraging communities to reach impact threshholds. By quantifying the impact per donation they increase donations - for example, every $65 quite simply buys a [biosand filter](http://www.charitywater.org/cambodia/) in Cambodia. I believe that the marketing adage from my professor applies to this situation - people are more likely to buy the impact of a biosand filter than they are to blindly donate $65.

In general, investment companies have to deal with the same problem - "you have extra money and we think you should give some of it to us because it pays off in the long term." Their marketing strategies have focused on slowly adding cash to long-term savings accounts using tricks - for example, [Acorns](https://www.acorns.com/) invests "spare change" into a brokerage account. However, I hypothesize that the book [The Millionaire Next Door](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1589795474/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1589795474&linkCode=as2&tag=sagacionlook-20&linkId=QLUHTGCRRMNUUAI3) created more cash influx for investment companies than their own ads because it sold the impact of being a millionaire, rather than try to just acquire customers through perks.

For charities, there exists an opportunity for a donation platform that sells impact instead of begging for spare change - whether it be water for a village or school supplies for a local school. The realization that donations create a difference instills a sense of pride, and thus creates a feedback loop that drives future investments.

I [saw Bill Gates speak last year](/reading-vacation) and what fascinated me was that his foundation can quantify the cost of saving a human life. It feels odd to dwell on, but if your charity costs over this amount, then more lives may be saved with the same money elsewhere. Being a charity that is a clearinghouse for selling "impact" would be fascinating. People don't donate money because they like giving away cash - they donate because they want to create social impact, and their money is a means to that end.
