title: Launching the OpenLate Meetup Group

This week I am launching the [OpenLate Meetup Group](http://meetup.com/openlate) - a San Francisco evening hack lounge. During the day, San Francisco's coffee shops are packed with engineers innovating with the latest technologies. During the evenings, the city lacks places to work and continue that energy. OpenLate provides an evening work spot for coders as a freeform hack night. 

The [first meetup](http://www.meetup.com/OpenLate/events/162946472/) is Monday, February 10 from 8PM to midnight at the [OpenDNS office](http://www.opendns.com/about/contact/) near the SoMa Caltrain station. We will provide a place to work and blazing-fast internet. The plan is to continue hosting an OpenLate meetup every two weeks at OpenDNS. 

The idea was kicked off by a twitter converstion with [Zed Shaw](http://zedshaw.com/#/start) about places to work at night. When I had trouble finding one, I decided to make one. I had participated in a similar monthly meetup in St. Louis at [The Able Few](http://theablefew.com) that was a great place to meet and learn from other developers.
