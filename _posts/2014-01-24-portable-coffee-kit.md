The coffee in Cleveland sucks. The closest decent brew I have found is 150 miles away in Columbus. While going home for the holidays, I needed a solution to keep me caffeinated in the coffee tundra of Northeast Ohio. I devised a coffee kit capable of sustaining me through a week in Cleveland.

## Creating the kit

The core of a coffee kit is the brewing device. Most days, I brew coffee in a glass Chemex. My first Chemex did not survive my move to San Francisco, so it was immediately disqualified as a travel coffee device. I settled on an Aeropress as my travel coffeemaker of choice. 

The plastic Aeropress was invented in 2005 by [Alan Adler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Adler), the President of Aerobie. After building frisbees that still fly after being chucked at brick walls, Alan built a coffee maker that stands up to abuse. The three pieces - the body, the plunger, and the filter - work in the same basic way as a French press. However, the resulting coffee is has a stronger, cleaner flavor. The plastic device has quite a cult following - including  [an international Aeropress competition](http://worldaeropresschampionship.com/).

The Aeropress uses disposable paper filters. I wanted a coffee kit that wouldn't be limited by my need to pack enough filters. So, I experimented with metal Aeropess filter replacements from [Able Brewing Company](http://ablebrewing.com/). Their metal Aeropress filter comes in two styles- the *Disk* and *Disk Fine*. Both are perforated discs, but the *fine* is made with thinner metal and more perforations. I found little direct flavor difference between the two, but the thinner metal of the disk fine is sharp enough to cut your fingers. So, keeping in mind my safety and the likelihood of TSA seizure, I opted for the standard disk in my kit. 

Storing beans was not something that I originally considered necessary. However, Able Brewing also makes another Aeropress accessory that turns the hollow plunger into a storage container. I was able to fit a little over 90 grams of coffee - enough for 5 Aeropress brews - in the handle. Thus, the Able Travel Cap joined my kit. 

The key to craft coffee is ratios. To maintain that ratio, a scale is an absolute necessity. I sought the smallest scale with large, readable numbers for use with the Aeropress. While browsing Amazon, I knew that I found the right item when the *Customers Also Purchased* section showed herb grinders, rolling paper, and lighters. 

The dominant coffee hand grinder is the [Hario Mini Mill](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001804CLY/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B001804CLY&linkCode=as2&tag=sagacionlook-20). I still own and use the one I purchased four years ago, but it is difficult to keep clean. Baristas encouraged me to try the Porlex mini steel coffee grinder. The Japanese-made stainless steel grinder with ceramic burrs is basically the equivalent of a $300 electric coffee grinder, but without a motor. Relative to the plastic Hario Mini Mill, I find it much easier to disassemble and clean. It also is slightly more compact. 

I omitted a thermometer because waiting for water to cool for 5 minutes after boiling generally put it in the proper brewing range of 195 to 205 degrees. 


## How To Use it
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h3>My Aeropress Disk Recipe</h3>
<ol>
<li>Place the Aeropress with Disk on top of a coffee cup. </li>
<li>Add hot water to warm both the press and the cup. Discard the water. </li>
<li>Add 18 grams of medium-ground coffee to the Aeropress, and tare the scale. </li>
<li> Pour 220 grams of water over a period of 20 seconds. The water should be between 195 and 205 degrees Fahrenheit - about 5 minutes off of a boil. </li>
<li>Wait 90 seconds, then remove the setup from the scale and plunge for 30 seconds.</li>
<li>Stop plunging just as the water level reaches the beans - if you hear hissing, you have plunged too far. </li>
</ol>
<strong>Note:</strong> Do not plunge on the scale. The force will throw off the calibration!

## Travel

The travel coffee kit survived as carry-on luggage, and it produced excellent coffee. For the first time ever, a decent cup of coffee was available to me in Cleveland. Since this trip, I have found myself carrying the kit around on business travel and other occasions. In fact, as I write this I am enjoying coffee from this kit up in the mountains of Tahoe - just note that the boiling temperature is lower at altitude!
