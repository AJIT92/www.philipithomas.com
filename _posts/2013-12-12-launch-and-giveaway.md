I have been working on this blog as a side project for a few months, and today I am officially launching it. Brouhaha shares explorations in learning and culture. In the last week, it has experienced significant traction with a #1 Hacker News post and a [feature in Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/make-your-own-cold-brewed-tea-in-a-jar-1477800155?utm_campaign=socialflow_lifehacker_twitter&utm_source=lifehacker_twitter&utm_medium=socialflow). To celebrate the launch, I am giving away a valid invitation code to the [Google Glass Explorer Program](http://www.google.com/glass/start/). 

## Giveaway

To celebrate the launch, I am giving away an invitation code to the Google Glass Explorer Program. The code allows you to purchase a pair of Google Glasses prior to their public launch. 

Click below for the full details, but the code will be given to a random member of the mailing list this Sunday.

## Stickers

Anybody who signs up for the mailing list receives a free sticker.

The color used in the theme of this blog is the variant of [international orange](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_orange) used on the Golden Gate bridge. Here is a picture of one of the stickers on the Golden Gate Bridge, with Alcatraz in the background.
