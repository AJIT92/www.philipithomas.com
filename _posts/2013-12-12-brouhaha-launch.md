I have been working on a lifestyle blog that focuses on travel, learning, and food for a few months. Today I am launching [Brouhaha](http://www.brouhaha.io) - Explorations in Learning and Culture. For the launch, I am giving away an invitation code to the Google Glass Exlorer Program - [learn how to enter here](http://www.brouhaha.io/giveaway/). The blog has already received considerable traction, including a [feature this week in Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/make-your-own-cold-brewed-tea-in-a-jar-1477800155).
