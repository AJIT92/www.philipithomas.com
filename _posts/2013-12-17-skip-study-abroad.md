For many of my friends, studying abroad was one of the most important parts of their undergraduate education. They traveled the world, made new friends, learned in new environments, and expanded their cultural horizons. Every night was a party, classes were easy, and most time was spent focusing on socializing. 

I am a major proponent of travel and exploration, but in my opinion, study abroad is not the best place to do it. It wastes a semester of your education, and it does six months of damage to your personal and professional networks. 

## Hiatus

At one point, I wanted to go on study abroad. I found an amazing engineering program at the Technion Israeli Institute of Technology. I set about contacting my professors and academic advisors to see if my course credit abroad would impact my academic plans. By the end of the week, I was in the office of the head of my department, negotiating on which courses abroad would suitably replace courses taken at home. I was requesting syllabi, comparing textbooks, and rearranging my planned classes for after my return. 

To the credit of my department, they were quite accommodating of this rigmarole. By the end, I had figured it out - I had the perfect mix of classes that would let me study abroad. I would have to drop my physics major to a minor, and I risked losing the accreditation on my engineering degree, but dammit, I was going to Israel.  

Then, I took a step back. I started looking at the courses I would be taking abroad, and I realized that I cared about none of them. Classes like Graphical Engineering Information and Partial Differential Equations either repeated quite closely the courses I had taken, or interested me little relative to the classes I had planned at my university. 

I took the weekend off, and pondered about my goals for college. For some majors, such as foreign languages or art, spending time in another country made sense. For engineering, it was practically possible to complete most studies from the comfort of one’s couch. 

My goals for college consisted of following my passions and learning the most possible. For most students, study abroad does not directly contribute to those goals. Classes tend to be less rigorous, which means that you learn less. You are removed from your academic support structure, including advisors and resources. You no longer have the consistency of a familiar environment, including housing and food. 

If you wish to travel, make memories, and see the world, it can be done for much less than the price of tuition. At a private university, the price of a semester’s academic tuition, not including housing and food, is about equal to the budget necessary to vagabond through Asia for twelve months. 

There is a reason colleges put most students in a dorm room and provide dining services - minimizing distractions allows most of your time to be spent directly on learning. Does study abroad contribute directly to your learning, or is it a vacation disguised by a small academic course load?

## Disconnect

For most productive people, falling off the face of the planet for 6 months does irreparable damage to their personal and professional networks. Students with long-term goals - such as those planning on attending graduate school or particular industries - will not have the time in their schedule to move abroad for a semester.  

When pursuing long-term goals such as a job, starting a company, or entering into graduate school, you must keep in contact with people who can help with those plans. Whether it is attending networking events, saying hello to professors who will write your recommendation letters, or being available as a resource to others, being abroad limits your ability to effectively maintain these connections. You will be surprised how quickly-paced college can be, and how disconnected you can become during the term of study abroad. 

While abroad, your ability to create and extend a network is minimal. From my experience and observations, it takes about a year of effort in a new location to build a network that can prove useful to you. During that time, you must aggressively socialize - whether it is a startup events, [Meetup groups](http://www.meetup.com/), work programs, or clubs. After that year of effort, you can begin to reap the benefits of your network. Beyond just "knowing people," you will be able to make valuable connections, get in contact with people you with to, and have the credibility to act as a leader. 

Most study abroad terms are not long enough that you can effectively establish yourself in a city. Upon leaving, you will have new friends and connections to a city, but you will lack the firm rooting that could benefit you after you move home. Meanwhile, the network that you have been cultivating at your university suffers damage. Typically with study abroad in the second semester Junior year, this damage is during the worst possible time. It is during Senior year that you will begin to fully leverage your network - every personal and professional connection serves as a possible reference, referral, or gatekeeper as you make post-graduation plans. Spending the first semester of your Senior year rebuilding and repairing your network after being abroad hinders your ability to achieve your goals.

## Conclusion

In some cases, study abroad makes sense. In academics, immersion is key. For studies of language and art, immersion may require spending extended time abroad. However, for most areas of study, spending a semester abroad hinders immersion by pulling you from your familiar environment and stable academics to a new environment hinders your abilities to learn, to to network, and to achieve your goals.
