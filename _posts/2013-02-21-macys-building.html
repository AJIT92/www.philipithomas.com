title: Exploring the Abandoned Macy's Midwest Headquarters
---

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
	The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_Exchange_Building_(St._Louis)">Railway Exchange Building</a> was built in 1914, and at the time was was the tallest building in St. Louis.  At about 1.2 million square feet, the building is humongous, and still remains the 2nd largest building in St. Louis by square footage. It housed the flagship Famous-Barr store, then became the headquarters of May Department Stores.
</p>
<p>
	When Macy's acquired May Department Stores, the Railway Exchange Building became the midwest headquarters for Macy's. The space featured a photo studio in the basement, a seven-story megamall complete with restaurant and spa, and 14 stories of office space that controlled purchasing, marketing, and operations for Macy's malls in the midwest. 
</p>
<p>
	Macy's withdrew almost completely from the building by 2008, leaving only a two-floor functioning Macy's mall. and a technology incubator on the twelth and thirteenth floors. The rest of the building is basically abandoned. 
</p>
<p>
	Here are some pictures from exploration of the abandoned parts of the building, starting with the roof, then exploring the office spaces (floors 8-21), then the abandoned mall (floors 3-7, with the still-functioning mall on floors 1-2), and then the basement. Note that we had permission to explore, but there have been since been policy changes and this is no longer permitted.
