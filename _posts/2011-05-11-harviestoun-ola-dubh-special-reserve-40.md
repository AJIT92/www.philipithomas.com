Each with new jobs about to begin, my friend and I sat down to open a special beer to celebrate. I retrieved Ola Dubh Special Reserve 40, a rare offering from the Harviestoun Brewing Ltd in Scotland. Harviestoun collaborates with the Highland Park Distillery in Scotland to age its Ola Dubh line in scotch casks. The brewery takes its Old Engine Oil, a complex porter from the main product line of Harviestoun, and then ages it in the casks formerly used to mature the 12, 16, 30 or 40 year Highland Park scotches. The result is a complex brew with pronounced peat and oak flavors. The name of the line, Ola Dubh, derives from Gaelic meaning ‘black oil.’ The bottle of beer we sampled was aged in the oak barrels formerly used to produce the 40 Year Single-Malt Highland Park Scotch, a whisky which commonly sells for $2000 a bottle. The quality of the oak was evident in the flavor of the beer, and the complexity of the Ola Dubh Special Reserve 40 made it indubitably one of the best beers I have tasted.

The single twelve ounce bottle is exquisitely packaged. A clean box holds the bottle, which bears a metal medallion featuring the Harviestoun logo. At first glance the bottle appears painted black, but when I poured the beer it became clear that the glass is translucent and the beer is nearly pitch black with red fringes apparent when held under the light. Little head presented itself, but what remained was dark and creamy. The smell is reminiscent of barleywine, and it consists of sweet sherry, peat, coffee, and vanilla. The taste morphs into a scotch with flavors of oak, musty peet, malt, and caramel. Hops join chocolate in the prolonged finish, which rounds out the tasting experience with an overall stout flavor. The finish even has lingering acidity on the tongue with some iodine, just like a good scotch whiskey. Overall, the most surprising part of this beer is the degree to which the scotch and stout flavors are so masterfully melded. The result is a consonant brew that highlights the magic that can happen during a beer collaboration.

Tasting the Harviestoun Ola Dubh Special Reserve 40 is an experience in and of itself due to the intricacies it beholds. Accompanying the beer with food or preceding it with other alcoholic beverages will unwisely dampen the experience. Due to its high price, this beer is best shared with another who can appreciate its complexities. Ensure that it has sufficient time to warm up if taken out of the refrigerator and serve in a quality tulip, snifter, or wine glass. When selecting a special beer to celebrate the end of a semester, this beer fulfilled the role due to its exquisite flavor and uncommon production process. Harviestoun Ola Dubh Special Reserve 40 exemplifies refinement in beer with pronounced scotch flavors and, though expensive, justifies its high price due to the rare production process.
