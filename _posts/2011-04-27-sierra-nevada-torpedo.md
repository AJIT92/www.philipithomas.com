Our previous article on <a href="{% post_url 2011-03-19-sierra-nevada-pale-ale-a-benchmark-beer %}">Sierra Nevada Pale Ale</a> ranks among our most popular reviews. I characterized it as a gateway to craft beer. Today I share Sierra Nevada Torpedo, which serves as a stepping-stone from pale ales to India pale ales. Bitter beers are quantified in their strength by International Bitterness Units, which measure the amount and strength of hops used in the brewing process. IBUs present an objective way to discuss the relative flavor strengths of beers. However, it should be noted that this measurement does not factor in the sweetness of the added malt, which can counteract the bitterness of the hops. Typical mass-produced beers such as Bud Light rank in the 5-10 IBU range and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is a moderate 38 IBU. IPAs rank in predominantly over 40 IBUs, though the most popular ones tend to be in the 70-110 IBU range.  Sierra Nevada Torpedo rests nicely at 65 IBUs, marking the entrance to the domain of bold craft IPAs. For those with an unaccustomed palate, this is a bitter introduction to the most artisan IPAs. To those experienced with bitter beers, this serves a smooth and palatable drink that errs on the side of timidity.

In the Sierra Nevada lineup, Torpedo is their mid-level hop beer. The Pale Ale marks the first rung with mild bitterness. Their high-level hop beer is the lesser-known but still widely-available Hoptimum (100 IBU), a potent brew that transcends the Torpedo to fulfill even the most discerning bitter-beer-lover’s appetite.  The Torpedo resembles a stronger and more concentrated version of their Pale Ale. It has a floral, citrusy, and vibrant nose that is characteristic of IPAS. The taste is a fresh and clean bitterness balanced by grapefruit sweetness. The finish is a soothing pine. As a lover of double and triple-IPAs that have higher bitterness and alcohol content, this is a bit of an underwhelming brew in terms of brute strength. However, I still recall the first time I had this beer, shortly after beginning an exploration into craft beer. Torpedo struck me as brilliant but overwhelming in bitterness. It was a unique experience at the time and was undoubtedly the impetus of my exploration into bitter beers.

For the excellent quality, Torpedo is a surprisingly inexpensive and widely available craft beer. It encompasses the accessible but artisan experience we strive to share. Fans of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale would be wise to try Torpedo, and those who appreciate the latter should seek Hoptimum from the same brewery. Sierra Nevada Torpedo straddles the boundary of pale ale and artisan IPA with crisp bitterness that surely recruits beer lovers into the world of robust bitter beers.
