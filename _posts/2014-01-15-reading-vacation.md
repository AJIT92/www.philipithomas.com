title: Take a Vacation to Read
description: An experiment in uninterrupted reading time.
category: essay
---

My preschool teachers told my parents that I "asked too many questions." As I grew older, I found the answers I wanted in books. This past October I attended an event featuring an interview of [Bill Gates](http://www.thegatesnotes.com/) by [Michael Moritz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Moritz), and Bill shared an idea that stuck with me. Every year, he takes a week-long vacation to read.  That idea stuck with me enough that I had to try it myself. I took a reading vacation, where I found the opportunity to focus on books, indulge my interests, and renew my creativity.

Frequent flyer miles made planning the trip feasible. I was joined by a friend who wanted a relaxing weekend before starting a new job. So, we booked a beachfront hotel room with an "upgraded view" in San Diego. I grabbed my [Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AWVXK5O/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00AWVXK5O&linkCode=as2&tag=sagacionlook-20), which came pre-loaded with the dozens of books I've randomly purchased over the last year with the impulse-inducing "Buy It Now" button, and off to Southern California we went. 

In hindsight, a description of the trip sounds boring - I just read, with the occasional breaks for caffeine, booze, and food. A typical day consisted of waking up, reading on the porch as the sun rose, eating breakfast, reading on the beach, eating tacos, reading at a coffee shop, reading on the beach as the sun set, having dinner and a couple beers, then reading in the hot tub with more beer. That simplicity was exactly what I sought.

There was good variety between styles within nonfiction, but I was still in fiction remission after reading Atlas Shrugged, so I had not been in the mood for stories. Being able to pick any fleeting interest then indulge it fully with a book on the subject felt powerful after the intellectual asceticism or procrastination occasionally associated with everyday life.  

When I returned from my reading vacation, I found a renewed creativity. I wrote many blog articles based on the books I had read, approached daily conversation differently, and found follow-up books to read. The isolation from the bustle of society made me feel a mixture of refreshment and intellectual stimulation. Two months after the vacation, I have found that it served as more of an impetus than an retreat - my voracity in reading continued after the vacation, and I tend to spend an uninterrupted day every two weeks reading. 


To focus on learning, follow interests, and stimulate creativity, try taking a reading vacation. The motivation to read is fueled by a desire to explore and learn. Setting aside time to read collected books brings answers to questions that you considered important. An isolated vacation provides the time and flexibility not just to read the books, but also to contemplate their content and answer the questions that prompted you to pick them up.

    <h3>Tips: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Pick a quiet vacation spot. I chose a warm area with lots of room to walk, but an isolated cabin in the middle of the snow would also probably work well.</li>
        <li>Bring a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AWVXK5O/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00AWVXK5O&linkCode=as2&tag=sagacionlook-20">Kindle</a> or variety of books. Don't have a set reading list - have options. </li>
        <li>Don't schedule activities throughout the weekend. Know a couple places to grab coffee or food, but don't make firm plans. </li>
        <li>Going with a friend makes it easier to talk out your thoughts and reflections while reading. </li>
    </ul>
