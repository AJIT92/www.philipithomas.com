title: Computational Analysis of Diffusion as a Stochastic System
---

<img src="/images/dla.png">
<p>In a biophysics laboratory course, my lab partner and I just completed an experiment on modeling diffusion as a stochastic system. Specifically, we modeled 1-D and 2-D random walks plus 2-D and 3-D diffusion-limited aggregation in Matlab. The code is on Github <a href="http://github.com/philipithomas/diffusion">here</a>. and the paper is below.</p>
