title: Minimalist Business Card
---

As dated as paper business cards seem, unfortunately I still get asked for them! Instead of bloating a business card with titles and companies that change, I decided to experiment by putting just one line on mine - my email address: [mail@philipithomas.com](mailto:mail@philipithomas.com).

Here is my rational:

* Email is my primary form of communication

* My name is in my email address

* My website is a subset of my email address

* Upon receiving a business card, most people initiate communication with an email. 

* [Additional contact information](/connect) is on my website

Here are my new business cards:
