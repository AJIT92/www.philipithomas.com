title: Cold Brew Experiment 1 - Yerba Mate
summary: Making cold-brewed yerba mate using a Toddy. 
---
*This is a first blog post about my experiments with the [Toddy cold brew system](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006H0JVW/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0006H0JVW&linkCode=as2&tag=sagacionlook-20). This covers making a [Yerba Mate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerba_mate) cold brew concentrate that is similar to iced tea.*

# Yerba Mate
[Yerba Mate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerba_mate) is a tea-like drink popular in South America that outsells coffee in Argentina and Paraguay. The flavor is similar to a grassy green tea, and it provides a caffeinated pick-me-up. 

I typically buy loose Yerba Mate at Whole Foods, but it is also available [online](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TNXSZG/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B001TNXSZG&linkCode=as2&tag=sagacionlook-20). 

# Cold Brewing

A subtle distinction exists between "iced coffee" and "cold brewed coffee." Iced coffee, such as that sold at Starbucks, is brewed hot like normal coffee, then chilled. Cold brewed coffee never exceeds room temperature - coarse-ground coffee is left to steep in water for about 12 hours, and the resulting liquid is stronger and less acidic than hot-brewed coffee. 

The [Toddy cold brew system](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006H0JVW/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0006H0JVW&linkCode=as2&tag=sagacionlook-20) is the most common method of cold brewing, and it incorporates a filter to remove coffee grounds and some oil. 

# Procedure

I have decided to begin experimenting with various types of cold brews - beyond the traditional coffee - using the toddy equipment. I have been drinking Yerba Mate for years because I like its energy boost better than that of tea. It also is less harsh than coffee, making it more palatable for long study sessions. 

To make Yerba Mate Cold Brew, I followed the [Toddy](http://www.toddycafe.com/customerservice/instructions.php#tea) instructions for tea:

1. Dampen the Toddy filter and insert it in the bottom of the vessel.

2. Insert the cork in the bottom of the Toddy.

3. Add 3 cups of water.

4. Add 8 ounces of loose Yerba Mate.

4. Gradually add an additional 6 cups of water. 

5. Cover and let sit for 15 hours at room temperature. 

6. Remove cork and let drain into a pitcher.

# Results

The Yerba Mate cold brew concentrate is like rocket fuel - I mixed about three parts of water to 1 part of concentrate. The flavor is remarkably smooth, and it notably lacks the bitterness that can accompany hot-brewed Yerba Mate. 

Cold-brewed coffee is an excellent ingredient in cocktails, so I intend to experiment with Yerba Mate cold brew cockatils. I suspect that a mix of tequila, Yerba Mate cold brew, agave, and lime would be a delicious [daiquiri](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daiquiri)-like drink.
