<h2>Moblico</h2>
<h3>Heroku of Mobile Apps</h3>

<p>
Pierre Barbeau provided the first pitch of the day for his company, Moblico. Moblico provides a back-end API framework for mobile application developers. Creating a successful mobile application requires far more than just writing an iPhone app - it requires writing a whole serverside program that handles data, which mobile applications communicate with through an API. 
</p>
<p>
	The Moblico team - veterans of Sprint who worked on phone apps long pre-dating smartphones, identified a need to provide an easy way to build that server-side half of mobile applications. Moblico provides that API as a Platform as a Service. They already have significant revenue, and are raising a $1.5 Million round.
</p>
<p>
	In addition to providing this back-end framework, they have started providing notifications through push notifications and SMS. 
</p>
<p>
	This platform strikes me as brilliant because it parallels the rapid development framework of Heroku that made it a standard for web applications. After a developer starts using the platform, it takes significant effort to move away, thus creating quite low churn. The Pipeline judges questioned the rationality of revenue streams outside the base subscription, but providing access to other features, such as SMS notifications, also parallels the Heroku application add-ons, which have been quite successful. </p>
<p>
	What concerns me about Moblico is their ability to provide adequate support for developers. Namely, making the use of their platform easy, and keeping it updated and relevant, are the keys to their growth. In order to do this, I hope that they maintain a strong engineering department.

<h2>Fliphound</h2>
<p>
	Brandon Shuey shared his vision of bringing digital advertising efficiency to the ubiquitous billboard. His company matches advertisers with owners of digitized billboards. As advertisers 

</p>

If they're too good, they might get banned - Spain style. 

Hard to target people - loses digital advantage 

pre-revenue but raising 750k to provide a 24 month runway - too ambitious and an unproven idea. 

Probably expensive to run. 

Too much of a land grab, and the difficulty is that they must acquire both advertisers and billboard owners, and uniting these two different types of businesses will prove difficult. 


"Next 30 days" 

Complex pricing strategy


<h2>Opendorse</h2>
<h3>Lead-gen and CRM for small sport endorsement deals</h3>

Blake Lawrence, a former college athlete, shared his platform for 

Cool idea, but not a busienss
CrM for contract negoationas

WAy too narrow a market

Haven't yet validated their idea 

Lockerdome could destroy them

Most of their business will look inflated because they will allow little athletes to get connected to little sponsors, and they will miss out on the big money. 

They have a "matching" algorithm, but I bet it is shitty. 


<h2>Invenquery</h2>
<h3></h3>







<h2>Metactive Medical</h2>

Xandra Sifuentes

Treates aneurisms

Founders had a huge exist with last company - Proteon Theraputics. 

Main product - ballstent

Founders seem to be hands-off approach. 

Still non-clinical - only animal data. 

Subsidiary of novita therapeutics, which raises an alarm for me. 

Also have block stent

European launch - 2016. US launch - 2019. 

Probably exit quickly; raising a $12 M round. 

Judge hits it - too early because we don't have human trials (Magda Marquet)



<h2>Infegy</h2>

Justin Graves shared the tool Social Radar from his company Infegy. Already at $1.2 million in revenue with no investments, their traction shows 

Social media analysis

My original concern was the technology behind the business. Correct analysis of social media requires extensive crawlers, huge databases, and sophisticated algorithms. I was surprised to see Infegy approaching the industry correctly with hundreds of processors and a fifth of a petabyte of data covering the last 6 years. 

What happens when social media becomes more privatized? 

Having this much raw data is quite useful, and my second concern was whether consumers could run their own algorithms on the dataset. It turns out that they can. Though the API you can run custom queries using their 

Overall, they sell data in a data-driven world, and I forsee success. 


<h2>SkyVu</h2>

Ben Vu shares his company that provides, "[. . .] comedic violence that's safe enough for peopel of all ages."

Without funding, they have 35 employees adn had $3.5 million in revenue last year. 

Investors will be skeptical after the Zygna SNAFU

23M downloads with 2M monthly users

Cost of acquisition: $.40; lifetime value: $1.60

Definitely a good lifestyle business, but not investable right now. The founder has created a cool business, he's employing 35 people, and it is a great business. 

Expanding to Korea, followed by China and Brazil

Just landed on Android

Creating out-of-game atmosphere with agressive licensing. 

Not going to win because not investable enough. 

Raised two rounds - angel then institutional.
