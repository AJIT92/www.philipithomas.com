title: Cleveland's Greenhouse Tavern Loses Its Luster
summary: Food creates strong memories. Food that fails to live up to prior experiences is a nightmare.

My family has been going to [Greenhouse Tavern](http://www.thegreenhousetavern.com/) in Cleveland since it opened in 2009. As Chef Michael Symon was receiving national attention as an Iron Chef and TV Show host, the locals realized that Chef Jonathon Sawyer, an alum of Symon's flagship Lola restaurant, was the real star of the local food scene. With ambitious dishes like coq au vin served in a puff pastry shell and offal delights, the farm-to-table food appealed both due to its precise execution and due to its strong, unadulterated flavors. After I moved away from Ohio, we returned to Greenhouse Tavern for special occasions, such as my grandparents' 50th wedding anniversary.

As I returned to Cleveland for Thanksgiving this year, when asked which restaurant I wanted to visit most, I quickly answered Greenhouse Tavern. Any kitchen that stocks its friers with duck fat owns my heart. Plus, since I had left, the restaurant had been the center of national media coverage. Unfortunately, my return tonight was an all-around bad experience. 

The first red flag was that many of the classic menu items had been replaced by burgers and a "steak and fries" entree. [Some](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Bourdain) might even say that they had gone soft by offering vegan, paleo, and gluten-free options. No longer was the coq au vin or the pork belly available. Instead the menu was . . . simplified.

Having difficulty picking what to eat, I selected the Chef's 5-course tasting menu. I was surprised when I was still asked to pick entrees off of the menu - I was under the impression that the chef's tasting menu was the chef's choice. I pushed the issue and asked that the server actually have the kitchen pick their favorite dishes. 

The amuse bouche was fairly unamusing - it was a two-bite salad with anchovy. 

When next course, bacon-wrapped dates, arrived, the focal point of the plate was the garnish - a large hair. It took some time for the kitchen to remake the dish. 

The following course was the restaurant's classic hand-chopped steak tartar, served with duck fat-fried french fries. I was excited because I had enjoyed this appetizer many times in the past. Unfortunately, the tartar was underseasoned to the point of tasting like dogfood. The fries, on the other hand, were closer to a salt lick than the fatty deliciousness I remembered. To top it off, the dish was served with a chilled soft-boiled egg for dipping whose temperature was surprisingly offputting, and the garnish was raw garlic. 

The main course turned out to be the rabbit rag√π, which I had been eyeing on the menu. Yet again, the seasoning gods had failed me - the dish was salty to the point of being inedible. The waitress took the dish and had the kitchen prepare a medium-rare steak and frites for me, which my dad had been enjoying next to me. The manager kindly delivered a small salad to eat while the rest of my table was dining. Even as a fan of bitter and fermented foods, I found the salad excessively vinegary.

When my steak arrived, it was unfortunately cooked to a perfect medium-well, and it was both dry and insipid. 

The service for the night was passable, but not what it should have been. One of the waiters had a bad habit of lunging up and down the stairs, thus making the upstairs section where we were seated feel like an earthquake. Three times during the meal did I have to request missing silverware to eat my courses, and it wasn't until the end that we noticed that I had received a steak knife, but my father had not - the same dish. 

At the end, the dessert was fairly tasty. Overall though, the experience and the response lost both customers and national advocates of the former star of the Cleveland food scene. When the waitress brought the bill and gave us a 15% "neighborhood discount for our troubles," it felt like a slap in the face - on a $200 bill for three people, we expected a flawless dining experience, not an unapologetic comp for the price of a single course. 

Based on our experience at Greenhouse Tavern, our memories of fantastic, innovative, and local cuisine with great service at Greenhouse Tavern shall remain just that - memories. On future trips to Cleveland, I look forward to returning to other excellent restaurants, such as Chez Francois and Lola, and leaving Greenhouse Tavern to sell the bar food it now serves.
