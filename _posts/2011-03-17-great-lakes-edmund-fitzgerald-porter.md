In honor of St. Patrick’s Day, I would like to share my favorite stout with you.  While it is made in Cleveland and goes by the name of a porter, it will outshine any Guinness product you gargle down the remainder of the day. Interestingly enough, the respective definitions of porters and stouts have converged. Historically, <em>stout</em> was used to refer to the strong, high ABV subset of porters, but nowadays brewers use the terms somewhat interchangeably. In fact, Guinness Extra Stout went by the name “Extra Superior Porter” until 1840.  The predominant flavor of stouts is roasted malt and barley with hops taking a back seat in quite the inverse of an IPA.

The Edmund Fitzgerald Porter is an outstanding brew that epitomizes the qualities that make a great stout. Chocolate and coffee hit the nose in a classic stout scent and the initial taste is mainly citrus with some mild coffee. That initial coffee flavor then aggrandizes into a balanced and delicious finish that is stronger than most other stouts. The flavor entertains the whole tongue, but does not feel as thick as a Guinness. There is a mild bitterness that harmonizes with the other flavors in a way that is barely perceptible during the first taste but that demonstrates the balance of the beer. Thick lacing enhances the experience by providing a satisfying texture on the tongue that rounds out the wonderful brew.

The intricacy of this beer makes it a great way to start an evening while your full palate is still intact.  Its accessibility marks one of its greatest attributes – it is brewed year-round by the Great Lakes Brewing Company and is priced at an affordable level while being on-par in quality with expensive Belgian ales. The lightness of the brew allows you to have more than one in a sitting without feeling satiated. If you have never explored porters outside of the mainstream brands, or if other porters have left you underwhelmed, Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald Porter is the beer to try.
