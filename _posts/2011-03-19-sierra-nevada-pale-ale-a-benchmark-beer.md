Sierra Nevada is an independent brewery based in Chico, California that makes some of our favorite high-value beers. Sierra Nevada has a core of classic brews combined with specialty and seasonal beers, which gives it a reasonable variety of high-quality brews. Pale Ale leads the brewery's lineup as the second-best selling craft beer in the United States. This is a classic pale ale that focuses on hops, but lovers of the beer may also enjoy the more potent Torpedo and the extremely potent Hoptimum offerings from Sierra Nevada.

The taste has bitterness with milder flavors of citrus and caramel, which defines the classic or standard pale ale flavor. The beer retains lacing when poured, giving it an enjoyable texture. The palatability is high and, among bitter beers, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is widely appreciated. The bitterness exists and is emphasized, but it is not overwhelmingly strong, giving the beer a nicely balanced flavor that leaves a pleasant aftertaste.

Sierra Nevada Pale Ale serves as an excellent go-to beer. Its low cost and high accessibility makes it easy to obtain. The flavor is simple, but it is strong and well balanced. Therefore, this pale ale can be enjoyed by those used to cheaper beers and those accustomed to more artisan offerings. Even after having beers multiple times its price, we feel that the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale serves as a good baseline and a basis for comparing various beers. It is not just a good beer for the price. It is a good beer, regardless of cost, and a great beer for the price.
