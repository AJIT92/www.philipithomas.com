# About
This is the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)-based backend for my website [www.philipithomas.com](http://www.philipithomas.com). The Ruby-based blog backend creates static websites that then load quite quickly.

I'm experimenting with hosting on the Rackspace/Akamai CDN, so hypothetically the site maintains quick load speeeds at scale.
